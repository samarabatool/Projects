	<div class="story" id="S3">
		<a href="Short film.pdf"> This is the script of a short sci-fi filmic video. I was supposed to make it in February, 2021, but the actors weren't ready XD. I decided to write this because firstly, I was really into sci-fi books at the time, and, secondly, because I had recenlty learnt video editting. <br><sub>-February, 2021</sub></a>

	<div class="storyalt" id="S2">
		<a href="The Wand.pdf">This is another short story about magic and fairies. (My Harry Potter obsession was clearly visible in most of my stories between 2018-2020). I decided to write this due to a story writing competition, but unfortunately it exceeded the word limit. <br> <sub>-June, 2020</sub></a>

	<div class="story" id="S1">
		<a href="https://www.amazon.com//dp/B085J38GTP">Reba is a book I wrote in standard five, published soon after. I decided to write a story which would describe my fantasy world, in May 2019. Although this book is not something I would take pride in having written now, it has taught me a lot of things. <br><sub>-January, 2020</sub></a>
