An eleven-year old orphan girl, with brown hair and turquoise-greyish eyes, she was thinking about the next day which promised to be very eventful for her, as well as other children of the orphanage, as they were being taken for a picnic.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Rebecca had no living relative in McCluskie, the place where she was born. Separated from her parents, after they met with a tragic accident, she was sent to ‘ST OLIVERASIN ORPHANAGE’ named after the great grandfather of its present caretaker, Miss Jennifer Jenny.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Rebecca was sent to the orphanage as there was no one in McCluskie to take care or give her shelter in their house as they considered her cursed and thought her presence might prove inauspicious and take away their blessings. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">It was at St Oliverasin that Rebecca found a good friend Emma, who used to call her Reba, as she found it a little awkward to pronounce Rebecca every time she had to take her name. Soon all others also started calling her Reba.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <img src="57beaa33-96c1-4eca-a89b-ce4bf60c471e20037458619508905.003.png" alt="" style="-aw-left-pos:0pt; -aw-rel-hpos:column; -aw-rel-vpos:paragraph; -aw-top-pos:0pt; -aw-wrap-type:inline; width:100.00%; " /> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">In the orphanage</span><span style=" font-size:1.0rem ;letter-spacing:0.25rem">,</span><span style=" font-size:1.0rem"> Reba and Emma shared the same room, located in the leftmost corner of the top floor. It earlier served as the storeroom for the orphanage. It wore a decrepit look as coat of paint was peeling off in several places and a wooden plank beside the door was missing.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">The room had a large window with a broken glass and a blue worn out curtain. The window was created after Reba and Emma shifted in. Despite its terrible condition, Reba and Emma managed to keep the room liveable by keeping it neat and tidy using whatever discarded and abandoned things they could lay their hands on. It was just the cobwebs hanging on their ceiling, which they couldn’t reach on their own, that gave it a creepy look. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">The door of their room had a paper-hanging made from used notebooks of Reba and Emma. There was a damaged toy plane hanging from their door latch which had once ploughed through their window. The kid flying it outside the orphanage had lost its control, and later when Reba and Emma tried to return it, he refused to take it back as he found it broken. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">A small jute mat lay just in front of their beds, and, the wall beside it had a photo frame of Emma and Reba, with the pictures peeled off from their old identity documents, and, pasted on a piece of paper with scenery to provide background. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">There were two beds in the room one on top of the other. They strictly could not be passed off as a bunk bed as the beds were simply stacked one over the other to accommodate them within the small room. Emma and Reba always had to be careful while sleeping as Reba quite often slipped while climbing to her bed on the top. Emma too often bumped her head while waking up in the morning. The bed sheets were stained, which, could not be removed despite the best efforts of Reba and Emma to wash them.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">In the corner was a rickety table with three unsteady wooden legs, and an umbrella in the place of the fourth one. An old table clock – rummaged from the store, a pile of old books and stationery, a pair of scissors, and, a bottle of glue were mostly found on the table top.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">A corner in the room had a short cupboard with three shelves. Its top shelf was used by Emma for her dresses and books, the middle shelf by Reba for her dresses and books, and, the bottom shelf shared by both of them, was used for keeping their shoes and unusable stuffs.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Between the bed and the cupboard there was a small. It was made by Reba and Emma using a large cardboard packing box. They had made two crudely fixed shelves made up of canvas cloth reclaimed from a torn bag. The bag was rejected by one of the earlier occupants of the orphanage, and, was lying in the storeroom which was now being used as room for Reba and Emma. They used to keep their pencil case and other light personal belongings like rubber bands, necklaces, and, a few safety-pins.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <a name="_gjdgxs"></a><span style=" font-size:1.0rem">This room of Reba and Emma room was the poorly illuminated and was the smallest room in the orphanage. It was probably the most poorly maintained room at St Oliverasin. Seeing it one could easily guess that Reba and Emma were not amongst the preferred ones at St Oliverasin. The only thing that looked fresh and clean was a handkerchief placed over the otherwise torn pillows. Miss Jenny, the caretaker, took special care to keep these on top of every resident’s pillow. She had superstitious belief that, one fine day the hanky will drain away their memory at night and on waking up, they will go away from orphanage without any memory of it. It certainly seemed a better idea than the children walking away with all their knowledge of it, as now they knew too much of its secrets. She wanted people to have a wonderful opinion about herself and the affairs of orphanage as she was heavily dependent on public charity to run the orphanage and manage its expenses.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Miss Jenny took sadistic pleasure in criticising the orphanage children and making them suffer emotional pain by repeatedly reminding them of the misfortune wreaked on them by their orphaned state, and, that they should learn to cope with their continued misery in the form of bleak destiny as there was no one in the world to help them. She often asked them to shun their unrealistic dreams and desires as they would have to fend for themselves. Her strategy perhaps seemed to be to make the orphans lose any hope about their future and believe that this Oliverasin its poor condition and shabby treatment was still the best hope for them.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Miss Jenny had a wicked sense and once reminded Reba that her parents died in a car crash, but UNFORTUNATELY, she had survived. As Reba was left speechless not knowing what to say, she enjoyed her confusion by asking is she sad at having lost parents or was she happy still surviving. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Miss Jenny loathed Reba and Emma as they, to the best of their ability, blocked negative emotions by not taking to heart Miss Jenny’s disparaging remarks and discouraging words.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Miss Jenny, the only daughter of Mr Oliver, took great pride in her own ancestry and never hesitated in reminding others of her illustrious family history. While introducing herself to strangers she was in habit of talking about her father and great grandfather of exalted position saying, “you must have heard his name, haven’t you”.  Her desire to portray herself and her family in highest esteem often led her to pull down others and their family background.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Miss Jenny was massively tall with grey-red hair, which barely reached her ears. Her usual outfit was dull coloured narrow skirts, classic looking white shirts with a bright red sweater, and, pink socks under her shoes. She wore accessories like bracelets made of seashells and one obsidian ring – her most precious possession. Her dressing behaviour suggested of her strongly superstitious nature. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">She lived in a dully painted, low lighted, cluttered room on the ground floor. There were dozens of empty bookshelves on the wall, as the books usually lay scattered and piled on the floor along with her clothes and stationery. Hers was probably the most luxurious but very messy room in the orphanage. During the time of her great grandfather it served as the common room of the orphanage.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">All students of St Oliverasin, except three including Reba and Emma, respected her and obeyed her for her elderly and matriarch status.&nbsp; However, Miss Jenny hardly responded in terms of her love and affection for them.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Orphanage children, except a very few whom she favoured, did their best to avoid Miss Jenny’s presence. They particularly hated the orphanage’s monthly picnics. It was full of drudgery for them having to obey command and orders of the caretaker for odd activities. Miss Jenny believed only she was entitled to relax and enjoy during these outings with children meant only to partaking through managing errand for her. This time for the picnic, they were visiting </span><span style=" font-size:1.0rem; font-style:italic">‘THE GARDENS OF PARADISE’</span><span style=" font-size:1.0rem">.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">After more than ten years of experience with Emma and Reba, Miss Jenny could not resist the thought that they were going to run away. Lately her sharp eyes had been observing their unusually confident and reassuring behaviour, instead of their typical meek responses. They were spending more than usual time together with each other and often avoided places where others were present. Whenever anyone came towards them they quickly changed the topic and dispersed. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Miss Jenny’s first doubt always veered towards Reba as she was always suspected to be the mastermind behind all their plans and mischiefs. Emma was never confident to do something bold, but Reba always was in favour of trying something daring.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Miss Jenny didn’t let them have much time together in private, be it their room or classes. She gradually started decreasing Reba’s influence over Emma. She separated Emma from Reba by making her sleep in her room over a pile of old newspapers covered with ragged quilt. Emma had to rearrange the newspaper stacks every day in order to make her comfortable. Miss Jenny didn’t allow Emma to attend the classes, which Reba attended, on some pretext or the other. So she used to give Emma extra lessons for the ones she didn’t attend. Reba was made to spend most of her time alone in her room without Emma. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Today was no different and Reba and Emma were not at all relishing this treatment by Miss Jenny. However, both of them by this time were strong in their resolve to escape Oliverasin as soon as possible.&nbsp; Not meeting the eyes of Miss Jenny they planned their escape.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Their plan went something like this: once they were in the “GARDENS OF PARADISE” they had to meet in a place away from the picnic spot, while Jenny would have been busy enjoying herself and gossiping with people. </span> </p>

   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Jenny in her excitement reached before anyone else, and, started shouting at everyone else to make haste. The shrill was loud enough to wake up the dead.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Before setting off for the journey to </span><span style=" font-size:1.0rem; font-style:italic">‘THE GARDENS OF PARADISE’ </span><span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Jenny cautioned all not to forget their responsibilities while enjoying. All of the children were allowed to take one bag of whatever they liked with them. After a short lecture of how to behave in the picnic, Jenny commanded them to sit in the bus which will take them to the picnic spot.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">It was a long, boring journey. Reba was made to sit with Moola, a plump girl in the orphanage with violet hair and a pierced nose. She partially liked as well as disliked the orphanage, often talking ill about it when with friends but praising it whenever Miss Jenny was within hearing distance. Emma was made to sit far away from her near Jenny.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">In a journey like this Reba and Emma could not do</span><span style=" font-size:1.0rem; font-style:italic"> nothing </span><span style=" font-size:1.0rem">and sit idle. They convinced Moola to give a few small crackers that she had rummaged from Miss Jenny’s personal storeroom. Emma cautiously placed the crackers under Jenny’s chair. The look on Jenny’s face was worth seeing when she sat in the bus and BOOM, the fire cracker exploded. All the children burst into muffled laughter, seeing the person they so feared and dreaded, standing horrified and stupefied in the aisle of the bus.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Miss Jenny was enraged and furious, but too embarrassed at the same time, to express her annoyance. She suppressed her urge to ask for the person who placed the cracker. She was intelligent enough to understand that the children were rejoicing in silence seeing her in this trouble state and very well knew nobody is going to speak up the truth about who placed the crackers. She decided to avoid making further show of herself and went back to her seat.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <img src="57beaa33-96c1-4eca-a89b-ce4bf60c471e20037458619508905.004.jpeg" alt="C:\Users\MY HUSSAIN\Desktop\New folder\scan0007.jpg" style="-aw-left-pos:0pt; -aw-rel-hpos:column; -aw-rel-vpos:paragraph; -aw-top-pos:0pt; -aw-wrap-type:inline; width:100.00%; " /> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">However, this remained a topic for t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;tes for the rest of the journey. The most unusual though happy part of this was that Miss Jenny didn’t scold anyone. The children still could sense trouble lurking around them. They were sure of Miss Jenny venting her ire on them on some other pretext as she would definitely be looking forward to extract her revenge for being made to suffer publicly this embarrassment and humiliation. </span> </p>

   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">After reaching their destination, which was indeed a pleasant location, an old plaque with inscription quite hard to read, announced that they were entering “</span><span style=" font-size:1.0rem; font-style:italic">The Gardens of Paradise”. </span><span style=" font-size:1.0rem">The garden was huge with unending boundaries. It had only a few guards all of whom were active </span><span style=" font-size:0.92rem">in their patrol </span><span style=" font-size:1.0rem">to protect the whole garden and maybe a few places around it too. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">After Miss Jenny’s instructions to gather back in an hour’s time to have lunch everyone dispersed in small groups exploring different nooks and corners of the garden. Miss Jenny held back a few children, including Reba and Emma, and made them tie a hammock between two trees as she sat on a reclining chair. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Reba and Emma were the first ones to complete their task, and, get away from Jenny without attracting anyone’s attention. As planned, both of them gathered as much food as they could fit in their bag packs. They then reached a huge tree at the far end of the picnic spot near the forbidden area – the venue of their rendezvous – taking separate routes, so as to avoid alarming Miss Jenny about them attempting to run away or even meet in isolated places. More than worry of them landing in trouble, Miss Jenny was concerned about what explanation she will give to the people, especially the funding partners of St. Oliverasin, if any of the children are reported missing. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Once they reached the tree Reba informed Emma in a hushed voice, that she had packed all the necessary things like, the wall clock, a few bottles of water and two pairs of dress for each of them yesterday itself, when everyone was busy having dinner down in the common room.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘That’s really good!’ exclaimed Emma with a little smile, and asked, ‘What now? We escaped Jenny but they will soon find us here.’</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Reba looked around just to ensure no one was watching, turned back to Emma, and said, ‘Don’t look back even  once, go straight and enter the forbidden area, don’t worry I’ve read all about the gardens of paradise, there are no guards in the forbidden area, it’s our best chance to get rid of the old beast. We will escape the gardens through the forbidden area. But first we need to get in there.’ She said in one breath. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Emma opened her mouth a few times to argue but was left with no choice but to yield and do whatever Reba suggested. Trusting her friend as always, she closed her eyes, ran as fast as she could until she was in the forbidden area. Reba followed her close behind looking back from time to time to see whether anyone had noticed them. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <img src="57beaa33-96c1-4eca-a89b-ce4bf60c471e20037458619508905.006.jpeg" alt="C:\Users\MY HUSSAIN\Desktop\New folder\scan0009.jpg" style="-aw-left-pos:0pt; -aw-rel-hpos:column; -aw-rel-vpos:paragraph; -aw-top-pos:0pt; -aw-wrap-type:inline; width:100.00%; " /> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">In a few moments both of them were inside the forbidden area. </span><span style=" font-size:1.0rem; color:#0d0d0d">The forbidden area was like a forest in appearance as well as in expanse. There were many tall trees forming a canopy. The birds, of so many different kinds they could not identify, were chirping in their nests.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem; color:#0d0d0d">After they travelled a small distance the forbidden area got denser and darker. The surface was damp with many moss covered sharp edged pebbles scattered on the ground. They crossed lot of thorny bushes on their way. They badly hurt their feet, with many scratches and bruises, as they covered the distance in a very short time. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Reba, can we please stop now? I don’t think this is ever gonna end.’</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘We shall need a shelter for tonight. Let us make a tent. We definitely can’t rely on the design we were learnt at St Oliverasin as we do not have all items we may need. Let’s design it ourselves even though it may take us some time. Please pass on the bags to me.’ Seeing no response, Reba shouted, ‘Emma are you listening! I am talking to you. What are you doing?’ Emma was startled and immediately jumped off the tree trunk she was trying to climb. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Um, nothing I thought I could gather some fruits maybe. But there aren’t any in sight. Wait! Giving the bags.&nbsp; Kept them over there, perhaps.’ Emma lunged towards the bag and tossed it quickly to Reba.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Obviously you won’t get any here, besides we already have enough food for at least till the time we escape from here. I will go and get some wood; in the meantime you tie together the bed sheets I kept in the front pocket of this bag, with the strings you would find there. We will need it to make the tent top.’ Saying this Reba swiftly disappeared behind a big tree.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Soon Reba returned and saw Emma still trying to tie the four bed sheets together. She joined her in fastening the sheets and then secured its edges with thin twigs they found around themselves. Emma then stood up holding the centre of the joined bed sheets as Reba nailed its four corners to the ground with heavy wooden log they found fallen under the tree nearby.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Emma then went inside the tent and placed another bed sheet to cover the prickly grasses. She then placed a tall tree branch, Reba brought from somewhere, in the centre of the tent to raise its ceiling a little higher.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">The tent looked very uncomfortable, but was good enough to give them night shelter. The crude tent pole made it even tougher for them to move their body or  lie straight. Threads and grass twigs were jutting out of the sheets. The grass pierced their clothes irritating them making it difficult for them to catch sleep. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Reba started a fire right outside the tent to keep herself and Emma warm, and, came inside the tent. They played card games till it completely bored them, as no one won. They didn’t really know how to play, but thought it would be fun to while away their time inside the tent, playing it with their own rules. Moola had given these cards to Reba the previous day while they were eating lunch. She told her that she had found it in Miss Jenny’s storeroom in the same place from where she had found the crackers. Unfortunately making rules for playing cards didn’t turn out to be as easy as Reba and Emma. </span> </p>

   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">As the night’s dark curtains fell over, they started hearing eerie noises. Even chirping of birds made them jittery, as they would have been, on hearing a tiger roar. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">They heated some food for the next day on the fire outside the tent but some animal took it away, as they were busy making the tent stable after its central pole had been knocked down unknowingly by Reba.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">They had no more energy to cook once again so they decided to sleep. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">But sleep kept them waiting for long as they both were worried about not having any protection from the wolves, about which Miss Jenny had alerted the children immediately after they had reached their picnic spot. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Neither of them talked, until Emma asked. </span> </p>

Lastly after a short walk along a large lake, they reached a huge banyan tree. Right beside it they saw an old dilapidated structure made of wooden planks with fittings suggesting it might have been earlier used as a washroom. Their initial thoughts, if any, of using it for easing themselves vanished as they peeked inside and saw many ants and mice.&nbsp; </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">They talked for a while and then proceeded towards the lake to drink water and also to fill their empty water bottles. </span> </p>

   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">The deer led them to a massive strange tree, with rose like leaves, and, loads of apple like fruits. They hid behind a blueberry bush keeping a close watch over the deer. As they waited they started eating tasty blueberries hanging in bush in front of them, and also, stocked them in their pockets after they could eat no more.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Suddenly they realised that the deer was disappearing somewhere. But oh!

   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Hurry! Jump in before the opening shuts us out!’ Sam shouted. </span> </p>

They were now sliding down a long bumpy slide, shaped by the long roots. All their wounds and bruises they had suffered on their way to the forbidden place, and in running after the deer, healed instantaneously. They were surprised that they were not feeling any pain despite the rough slide and subsequent fall. They thought they were lucky not to have hurt themselves and suffered bruises. They had expected it to be a rough landing, but no, it was as if they entered some zero gravity zone at the end of the slide making them feel as light as a feather</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">They found themselves in a beautiful place with lots of attractive flowers and unusual striking trees.

   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">As the deer kept running forward it transformed into a beautiful tiny fairy with wings.

We found a fairy!’ Emma had at last spotted the deer who transformed into a fairy. Emma was really excited as she loved fairy tales.

She just looked at three giants whom she had just encountered and smiled giving a shrill whistle. On her whistle a group of fairies of her size suddenly appeared out of nowhere with a smile. They were all of just six inches and had beautiful sparkly wings from which whenever they flew shimmer came out. The shimmer of a few fairies formed the word ‘WELCOME’ in the air. </span> </p>

   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">The fairies nodded. They led them to a giant gate decorated with bales of beautiful flowers and leaves. Emma went forward and tried to open the gate, but a fairy flew in front of Emma’s face and shook her head suggesting she should not try it. Emma looked at her friends who were now being pushed by the tiny fairies towards this gate Emma had tried to open. </span> </p>

Emily, Christophe and Rowena paid their obeisance, and seeing them Emma, Reba and Sam too dropped a courtesy. The princess returned their gesture with her own low bow.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Hi everyone I am Helena Bilius, the princess of Faixieland, daughter of Helga Bilius. But for you all I am Helley. The guarpies have told me all about you. Rowena, Emily and Christophe will take you to Olivia, she’ll give the perfect pair of wings for you all, and then you can fly or rest, as per your will. The mirror world time, the world from where you have come, is different from ours. It will be night here soon though it is afternoon out there. Enjoy yourselves, the Faixieland is yours.’ </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">As they all went out into the corridor, Rowena asked, ‘Did you like our princess?’</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem"> ‘We did like her pretty much.’ Emma replied.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Where are we going?’ asked Reba.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘To Olivia’s shop. We kan enter it zouh the palace or zouh ze main market. It iz a part of the palace. She iz aa preety humble woman. Sells wings for people like you. ‘er business ain’t going too good, but still, ‘appy you know, poor lady.’ Replied Christophe.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">The corridor led to the hallways of the palace which were all beautifully decorated. There were many photo frames with portraits of, maybe, the royal family and their ancestors. All the portraits showed emotions even though absolutely still. There were different models of lamp posts with caption ‘MIRROR WORLD LAMPS’, and also what seemed to be post offices, and, tiny models of gardens and parks. They found a photo frame with the name ‘Helena Bilius’, written at its bottom. Beside it was the portrait of Helga Bilius. Rowena informed that Helga Bilius was Helley’s mother.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Suddenly a pixie flew past them. Seeing it Sam asked, ‘Is it a guarpy?’</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘No, guarpies have pink gloves, and a pixie who is finding work has white ones, but this one seems to be a personal pixie of someone, as it has blue gloves.’ Rowena explained.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘We are ‘ere! It’s Olivia’s shop.’ Christophe said signalling them to go inside.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">As they went inside Rowena greeted Olivia and said, ‘Please give us the perfect pair of wings for Emma, Reba and Sam, the chosen ones.’ She seemed to say chosen ones sounding mystical, but her message was well understood by Olivia.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Beautiful! I am Olivia, come in have some water, my dears.’ Olivia the old fairy said, in a high pitched shrill voice, as she welcomed them to her shop. She didn’t let everyone inside her shop immediately. Rather, made them wait in lounge outside shop, before offering them their wings.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Sam you first come with me, I will give you your wings.’</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Olivia took Sam to another room, her main shop full of beautiful wings. She started searching the best pair of wings which suited Sam.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">She looked at Sam for a long time whispering his looks to herself.&nbsp; ‘Okay, tall, black hair, indigo eyes, interesting, interesting, got someone like that after ages. Ah! Got the perfect one.’ She flew to one shelf and brought a blue dragonfly wing with white, yellow, red and grey designs. She applied a type of magical invisible adhesive labelled the wingner, to this wing pair and attached it to Sam’s back. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">&nbsp;‘You can go now. Just think wherever you want to fly, and you will.’</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">As Olivia and Sam came out, everyone exclaimed their appreciation and got curious and excited for their own pair of wings.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Emma next.’ Called Olivia.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Emma rushed in after Olivia expecting to have a look at her own pair, but seeing a range of wings she was dumbfounded. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Long, curly, blonde hair, blue eyes. There we go!’ Olivia continued with her work </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">She attached purple butterfly wings with white blue and green design on Emma’s body. She usually gave dragon fly wings to the male fairies more than seven years of age. Butterfly wings were attached to girl’s back as it symbolized grace. The dragonfly wings represented chutzpah and manly hardiness. Their wings were concealed, most of the time, except when they had to fly. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘You next.’ Olivia said looking at Reba smilingly.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <img src="57beaa33-96c1-4eca-a89b-ce4bf60c471e20037458619508905.013.jpeg" alt="C:\Users\MY HUSSAIN\Desktop\New folder\scan0016.jpg" style="-aw-left-pos:0pt; -aw-rel-hpos:column; -aw-rel-vpos:paragraph; -aw-top-pos:0pt; -aw-wrap-type:inline; width:100.00%; " /> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Okay turquoise greyish eyes, brown curly long hair.’ After a long pause Olivia said, ‘Knew this day would come. Oh dear! Your highness I have believed and waited for this all along, and didn’t find her, please forgive me if I am wrong in picking up the right person.’ She then brought a beautiful pair of glow-in-dark pink butterfly wing with turquoise, orange, purple and white designs and attached it to Reba’s back. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">As wings were fixed to their body, there was nothing that could set them apart from the fairies in appearance. They looked exactly like any other fairy of the Faixieland. After sometime Rowena announced, ‘Time to fly.’</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">They were then guided and encouraged, by the fairies, to fly using their new wings which adorned them now making them look more fairy than humans.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Reba was the first one to fly. But her happiness didn’t last for long within seconds she fell down having lost her control.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Slowly Emma got hold of what the fairies were trying to demonstrate, and, flew in a straight line before bumping herself into a wall.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">It took some time before eventually everyone succeeded in perfecting the art of flying. After flying for about an hour, Christophe led them to their respective rooms. Reba bade Christophe farewell as she entered her room. Without sparing a single glance at her magnificent room, she let herself fall on the soft bed burying her face in the pillow. However, the thoughts of the entire day events activities did not allow her to sleep. Emma on the other hand was filled with enthusiasm and kept flying inside her room. Sam slept immediately after entering his room. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem; font-weight:normal">&nbsp;</span><span style=" font-size:0.92rem; font-weight:normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style=" font-size:1.0rem; font-weight:normal"> ****</span><br style="page-break-before:always; clear:both" /><span style=" font-size:1.0rem; font-weight:bold; color:#365f91">THE DREAM</span> </p>

   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Reba could not sleep easily. There were a thousand questions about Faixieland churning in her head. She by this time had three fairy friends who did not reveal anything about the Faixieland. Whenever they tried to inquire about Faixieland the fairies diverted them to some other topic such as flying lessons. Why were she and her friends being treated so nicely? According to many fairy tales she had heard and read, the mystical fairies didn’t welcome human intrusion into their life and land. What were the fairies’ intentions and plans? How will they, three eleven year old children, bring peace to their land? And why and how does peace not exist in such a magnificent world, where even wounds and hurts are healed instantly and nobody gets hurt despite seemingly perilous falls?</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">With these questions and exploration of their possible answers, Reba slowly slipped into a deep slumber.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">But unfortunately Reba’s ordeal was not over. Her thoughts when awake gradually merged into the dream after she slept.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">She saw herself walking down a deserted street, under some terribly horrifying mysterious circumstances, when she found herself to be in some strange place, and, suddenly two glistening things and a big bird came right in front of her. She didn’t dare touch them as she was didn’t know about their origin and their purpose of coming to her. The bird glided down at brisk speed hitting her right in the middle of her chest and immediately she woke up sweating profusely and could not sleep any further. She kept on reassuring herself, which was all that she could do. ‘Just a nightmare, nothing more. A nightmare not related to this Faixieland. I was walking and not flying. It was not Faixieland any way.’</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">She was famished as she had not eaten for almost a full day now. Springing out of the bed she thought of flying, and voila! She flew out of her room and reached the kitchen through the hallway. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">It was a huge kitchen without any usual cooking appliances, stoves or vessels. There were glittering silver and gold kitchenware, comprising predominantly plates and cutlery of different sizes were kept on ornate slabs, shelves and tables. The golden slabs were overflowing with fruits and nuts kept in silver plates and golden baskets. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">A big table, instead of the usual stoves and grinders, had many magical pixie wands. Reba didn’t had much knowledge about these wands its use. She picked up one of these, not so easy to grip, as the wands were the size of hair clips. Its size definitely suggested that it was to be used by pixies. As Reba swayed the wand, a big cupboard with three shelves opened in the corner. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">She flew swiftly towards the cupboard and found a shelf having apple pie with her name inscribed on it. The pie was beautifully decorated with caramel and cream, and looked delicious. Below it she saw two other shelves with the names of Emma and Sam inscribed on them. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">The pie was heavy, big and hard to carry, so she sliced a part of it and flew away with it. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <img src="57beaa33-96c1-4eca-a89b-ce4bf60c471e20037458619508905.014.jpeg" alt="C:\Users\MY HUSSAIN\Desktop\New folder\scan0017.jpg" style="-aw-left-pos:0pt; -aw-rel-hpos:column; -aw-rel-vpos:paragraph; -aw-top-pos:0pt; -aw-wrap-type:inline; width:100.00%; " /> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">She finished the pie and then started closely examining useful items neatly arranged and placed in her room. It was huge and spacious room. There was a soft and comfortable bed in the middle. An almirah, made up of crystal and gold, was full of beautiful robes and dresses. Reba found many interesting things like an old diary behind her almirah.&nbsp; It had some kind of incantations for summoning objects, making potions and many counter spells for dark ones. She didn’t even realise that it was half past four in the morning. She went to bathe and dressed in what she considered to be the finest robe in the almirah.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">While going to the dining hall, Reba thought she saw her last name ‘Roberta’ ] somewhere. When she turned back she saw a frame, adjacent to that of ‘Helga Bilius’, with ‘Rema Roberta’ written at its bottom.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Her name is so similar to mine.’ Reba thought. Rema Roberta's face too resembled Reba’s. She had the same brown hair that Reba had, and also, Reba’s twinkling turquoise eyes.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Thereafter, Reba found that all the queens’ portraits in that corridor had last name ‘Roberta’. Ignoring this as a mere coincidence she quickly flew towards the dining hall. Emma and Sam were already there.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Where were you?’ they asked. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Well, I was interrupted by the photo frames of royal family members.’&nbsp; Replied Reba.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Oh! Good, come sit here.’ Helley intervened in between awkwardly.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Reba sat in front of Emma and Sam. Seven plates, spoons and glasses appeared on the table out of nowhere. Christophe spoke, ‘Zhink of whazever you want to eat, and it will appear on your platez.’</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Sam thought of pancakes, honey and orange juice. Emma thought of mango juice and sandwiches. Reba thought of coffee, eggs and a toast. As they thought, these appeared on their plates. Their accomplices from Faixieland, had their own fairy food which the three from mirror world could not identify or relate to. It smelled and resembled as if many pancakes were crumbled and moulded into balls using honey as binding material.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">After the breakfast Reba and Emma went to Sam’s room. Reba narrated to Emma and Sam her questions about their treatment and reception at Faixieland, and also, the dream she had last night during the short sleep she could manage. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Don’t think much about whatever is happening to us here.’ Emma suggested.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Yeah Emma is right, be relaxed, it definitely seems they are treating us like a much awaited guests. They surely shall protect us from evil and not allow any harm come our way.’</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">But Reba didn’t want to listen. She kept on thinking about her dream and about what the fairies might be up to. What if the fairies harm them? After her experience with Jenny she could no longer trust anyone.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">After sometime Helley summoned everyone and asked them to accompany her to the fairy city.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘We’ll be glad to.’ Was their reply.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">They reached a big tower made of mirrors. It was almost as tall as ten grownup camels standing one on the top of the other. In a big hall there were many desks on which several fairies were sitting.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">As Helley entered the hall she asked the trio – Reba Emma and Sam to – to sit in a special row reserved for them. The fairies and Helley then started animatedly discussing some issues amongst themselves and seemed to reach a conclusion after sometime. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">After the fairies dispersed, Helley proceeded with the trio to the topmost floor which bore a bare look with no furniture and a missing wall giving full view of fairies swarming around the building. She reached the edge of the floor and announced, ‘You all will be happy to know that we have found the chosen ones. In their honour we are having a special ball tomorrow.’ </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Why are you organising a ball?’ Reba asked as Helley finished. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘For you all, because you are special.’  Helley replied hastily and abrupty. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">By this time Reba understood that Helley didn’t want to reveal anything about the chosen ones. She therefore just limited herself to proclaiming them special while announcing the ball. Her special could have meant anything. During a discussion with fairies, a little earlier, she had heard Helley use the word “special” for a prisoner who broke out of the prison. She had told the fairies, “We have found our special guests again and they are back in their paradise -their prison.” </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Reba knew that even if she asks about “special” now, Helley won’t tell much to her. So she decided not to bother about it and returned to the palace taking leave of Helley.</span> </p>

   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">As Reba kept thinking about all the strange happenings of the previous day – about being the chosen ones in Faixieland, her nightmare, and, being termed ‘special’ by Helley, she took her dress and went to her room without talking to anyone. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Absorbed in her thoughts she didn’t realise how quickly the next seven just flew away.&nbsp; She was reflecting on the general affairs discussions Helley had with the other fairies in the tall mirror tower. Probably, the fairies wanted Reba and her friends to solve the issue of the latest mass breakout of frisoners – the prisoners of the fairy world. But then they were caught again. Weren’t they? It didn’t make much sense to Reba, as the fairies already had very strong army with magical powers, capable of achieving much more than what the trio were capable of. Reba was getting an inkling from her dream and the mystical world she had read bout earlier, that may be, they were being ceremoniously treated in Faixieland to be sacrificed for some purpose. Even though her two friends were enjoying their wonderful time here in Faixieland, she was gradually getting convinced that they may not be able to return to their own world.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">She kept on suggesting new reasons to herself for being detained and being treated royally at Faixieland.&nbsp; However, she could not conclusively see anything sinister in the fairies action or behaviour. She gradually convinced herself that maybe the fairies didn’t have bad intentions but just wanted to keep them to do works related to the mirror world.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">She drew out of the shelf a book and started reading it. She did not even realise how fast time passed when Rowena reminded her that it was time for the ball. As usual, engrossed in a book she lost the track of time.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Although she was late, she managed to dress up quickly. Till now she couldn’t give a serious look to the dress brought by Rowena as she was still immersed in her thoughts. However, as she looked in the mirror after wearing it she could not help but appreciate its beautiful looks. Reba considered it to be perhaps the best dress she might have ever worn or seen in her lifetime. It was a light pink ball gown, with a few white pearls on it, perfectly complementing her looks.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">After dressing up, she tried to make her hair a little different from the usual. However she repeatedly tangled her braid as she tried fixing it. She got panicky and started looking out of the window to calm herself and may be spot some help.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Reba was on cloud nine when she saw a pixie with white gloves. This pixie may help her do her hairs, she thought, as it was neither a guarpy nor a personal pixie. She decided to break her silence lasting since breakfast today morning, and, mustering courage called the pixie, ‘Excuse me, Can you help me do my hair?’</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">The pixie smiled at her and flew into her room. She took out her magical wand and flicked it three times. In the first flick all the hair tangles made by Reba were removed, with the second flick a hair updo was perfected, and, the third flick resulted in a well adorned hairstyle with beautiful ornaments. </span> </p>

   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">As she thanked the pixie she realised that its gloves were slowly changing colour to blue!</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Why are your gloves changing colours? Are you my personal pixie?’ Reba inquired excitedly.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Please go to the ball, I’ll explain everything later once we have time.’ The pixie responded.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Reba flew straight to the ball. Everyone had partners, no one was left. Sam and Emma were partners. Reba seemed to be alone for the entire ball, but right at the moment she was relishing the thought of not being bothered for a dance, a boy with black thick rimmed glasses entered the hall, and asked Reba if he could dance with her. His name was William and looked nerdy for the ball in his casual appearance. He however had a magnificent flowing blonde hair. It looked as if he didn’t knew anything about Reba being the chosen one, or even that they are found, else he might never have asked her to dance with him. Reba could not refuse William’s offer to dance, as they were told that it was obligatory for everyone, along with the chosen ones, to have a partner in the ball.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Everyone was dancing, except Reba, Emma and Sam. They didn’t like dancing, and further William didn’t know how to dance and kept on stepping on Reba’s toes and gown.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">The three were quietly sitting together enjoying seeing others when William joined them and started narrating his childhood tales and of how he once made a pie with mud in his garden. Reba, Emma and Sam preferred his boring tales than to take themselves to the dance floor.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">As the clock struck twelve, Helley spoke, ‘Ladies and gentlemen, I, Helena Bilius, would like to announce that after years of hard work, we have found the chosen ones, a huge round of applause for them!’</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">William was surprised to hear this and excitedly repeated it to Reba, Emma and Sam. They too pretended as if they hadn’t heard anything about chosen ones earlier. ‘I knew princess Helena Bilius and guarpies will do it!’ William was boastful and over excited as he announced it to the trio. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Now I would like to call the chosen ones with their partners to join me on the stage.’ Helley announced.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Emma and Sam together ambled towards the stage. Reba too stood up reluctantly to go as she had to bear William for some more time. Stopping her on the way William frowned and said, ‘Where are you going? &nbsp;Princess Helena Bilius has called the chosen ones and not you.’ He gave extra emphasis on Helley’s name.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘I am the chosen one and you have to follow me up to the stage.’ Reba retorted in annoyance, as she was losing her patience with William after enduring him for long with his meaningless and uninteresting gossips.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">&nbsp;‘Oh! Really so sorry, Miss. Wait, let me make myself ready to accompany you, the chosen one.’ William all of a sudden started sounding like a sycophant.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <img src="57beaa33-96c1-4eca-a89b-ce4bf60c471e20037458619508905.017.jpeg" alt="C:\Users\MY HUSSAIN\Desktop\New folder\scan0020.jpg" style="-aw-left-pos:0pt; -aw-rel-hpos:column; -aw-rel-vpos:paragraph; -aw-top-pos:0pt; -aw-wrap-type:inline; width:100.00%; " /> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">William straightened his baby butterfly wings and took out a small comb from his pocket to comb his hair. While standing he instinctively pulled down his undersized coat to make it look fit well on him. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Oh come on fast!’ Reba exclaimed as she proceeded towards the stage.  William hurriedly joined her before they together reached the stage.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">As they were moving, everybody was cheerfully applauding for them. The fairies gathered in the hall were staring William in disbelief, for being fortunate enough to get his share of glory to be partner of Reba – the chosen one. They were now correlating Reba’s reluctance to dance to special attribute she had to have as a chosen one. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Thank you everyone and all the best Emma, Reba and Sam.’ Helley said once the four were on the stage. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">All were graceful in their presence, smiling and appreciating the fairies and the occasion, except William. He warbled, ‘Welcome princess.’ He was getting too intolerable for everyone with his idiotic acts.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">After the ball Reba flew straight back to her room. She didn’t bother as to who she had to partner. Neither did she mind the unusual stares of other fairies, nor the previous thoughts and dream that bothered her. She was just too excited to talk to the pixie who helped her with hair style.</span> </p>

   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘No problem, I think you are the most reliable person in the whole Faixieland.’ Reba said grudgingly, remembering fairies like Rowena and Helley, who hardly divulged anything despite knowing all.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Can you please tell me what all you know about the guarpies, and, the connection between their smiling on our arrival in Faixieland and us being considered the chosen ones?’</span> </p>

They watch everyone who comes here and choose a few for the job given to you. Amelia was the guarpy that you first met at Faixieland entrance. She is a very good friend of mine. I had a conversation with her about your arrival. She told me that she saw extraordinary intellect in Sam, keen observing skills in Emma, and, deep thinking, quick decision making and lot of intelligence in you, which makes you all a perfect team. That is why, may be, she smiled at you all.’ Rema explained.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Before Reba could say anything Rema cautioned her, ‘You might think I haven’t told you much about the Faixieland, but even this much may be enough for a pixie to spend the rest of its life in the frison, though I may be spared as I am serving  the chosen one. So please promise me that you will not tell anyone about this, except Sam and Emma.’</span> </p>

The whole room was topsy-turvy, except the bed. There were books like, “DREAM: A Mystery”, “Know what your DREAM MEANS by Violet Peterson” and “Dark omens of Dreams by Peter James”. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Reba couldn’t bear the level of Emma’s superstition as it looked very weird. They then went to Sam’s room, where they found both Sam and Emma together, talking loud enough to wake the dead. The atmosphere in the room looked tense as they were talking rapidly about something that seemed to have worried them.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Hi everyone, what’s going on here?’ Reba asked feeling awkward for interrupting their serious conversation.</span> </p>

You remember me telling you about those sparkly things and the golden bird? But you all weren’t interested in helping or even listening. So I thought over it and have convinced myself that they won’t harm us, because if they wanted to, they could have already harmed us.

   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Rema was leading. The flaet looked amazing. Flaet was the path in air usually taken by fairies and pixies to move from one place to another. These were unusual paths as there was no land, instead like most other places in Faixieland it appeared like kind of pink-blue cloud network connecting different buildings and places. There was a big building, probably a post office. Unlike post offices of mirror world where one had to drop letters in letterboxes for postal people to collect at a later time, here you just had to go inside the building and put it in a bag attached to a unicorn which immediately set off to deliver it to the right person. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">On the flaets there were magical lights which were visible only at night.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Where are we going?’&nbsp; Emma asked.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘I don’t know. I see a restaurant, let’s go there.’ Reba suggested. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">They went inside the restaurant. The restaurant was too crowded with fairies. The restaurant was full and everyone had a seat for themselves and enjoying their food. To their astonishment they found as more fairies entered the restaurant, seats appeared on their own without having to make them wait. Everything in Faixieland suggested that it was a mystical world where nobody had to encounter inconvenience. They were about to take their seats on the table when they heard a shriek.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Hey, Emma!’ Emily was calling them on spotting them in the huge crowd.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Hi!’ Emma responded.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘You shouldn't have come here all alone.’ Emily said.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘We are not alone, Rema is with us.’ Emma said, this time more confidently</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Who is Rema?’ Emily asked sceptically with a frown.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Just my personal pixie.’ Reba said interrupting their conversation.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Emily gave an intense scrutinising look at Rema and asked, ‘Did she talk to you?’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘No! Not yet. I don’t know why.’ Reba said trying to sound normal. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Okay enjoy yourselves.’ Said Emily.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">They took their comfortable seats as Emily left. There were less stares on them with fairies now feeling comfortable getting used to their presence. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Emma asked Reba, ‘Why did you lie? You said to us pixies can talk to their owners.’ </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘It wasn’t normal for a fairy to ask whether anyone’s pixie talk to them, I was a little over conscious not to reveal that Rema told me about the chosen ones.’ Reba whispered.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Excuse me; what would you like to have?’ All of a sudden a fairy dressed like a waiter appeared right in front of them. They were all startled and left speechless momentarily due to his sudden appearance.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Sam was first to reply, ‘Umm... a cup of coffee.’ </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Thank you sir, and what should I bring for you two?’</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Same order for both of us.’ Reba said.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">The waiter scribbled something in the notebook and coffee appeared for all of them instantaneously on their table.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Th... thanks.’ </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘I don’t understand anything happening here. I don’t even know whether we should stay here or run away? But run away? Where? I am utterly bewildered and have begun to dislike everything in this place. We weren’t allowed to do anything in Jenny’s surveillance, and now, when we thought we could do whatever we want to, we are stuck here, amongst the fairies and expected to help them. We don’t even know what they want of us.’ Emma said exasperatedly, as the waiter turned out of sight. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">No one spoke anything for some time engrossed in savouring their coffee until Rema whispered something to Reba. Immediately Reba asked everyone to cheer up as Rema had offered to take care of all their worries and doubts. Reba was having the feeling that her friends were unnecessarily doubting and getting worried and thus spoiling their chances to enjoy this lovely fairy place.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘I agree with you.’ Sam took a deep breath and said trying to appear cheerful to Reba.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem"> ‘Me too.’ Emma too tried to present a bold and cheerful self to Reba. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">By the time they had finished their coffee they appeared more relaxed, and, resolved to start enjoying small beauties and mysteries around them with no imminent danger from anything here. They were smiling and laughing, more than before, and it looked as if some of Rema’s confidence had rubbed on them.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">They came out of the restaurant and proceeded towards accessories and dresses shop ‘GOOSEBUY-SHOESBUY’. The presence of Rema had surely added to their confidence. Rema was successful in getting their confidence for herself and Faixieland.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Are we going in that goose-shoes&nbsp;buy thing?’ Sam asked.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Yeah.’ Reba said.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">They went inside the big building of the shop and found themselves in a huge place with no floors. The dresses appeared hovering in the air. Small airborne boxes with wands too were floating in the air. They didn’t buy anything, but became familiar with all the nooks and corners of the store, and its merchandise. Rema found a wand she wanted. Reba paid for her, with the little fairy money given to them by Helley for spending and buy things during their stay in Faixieland. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">From there they went to a place which probably was a small indoor stadium. It was hosting a fairy dancing competition in a big hall with no floor, and, a few chairs suspended in the air towards one side. There was a big stage in the centre around which fairies were flying while some other fairies were sitting on the chairs. Reba and her friends saw the fairy dancers coming one after the other in groups and perform in front of flying fairy audience. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Wow this is just epic!’ Sam said pointing towards a fairy, who all of a sudden disappeared and came back flying through the window of the hall. Sam almost fell off the chair he was sitting on, as a fairy whizzed past, swirling very close to him.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">The concluding event was something very amazing with fairies performing acrobatic dance based funny skit. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Oh! See the dancer in the middle. He forgot his step.’ Emma laughed pointing to one dancer on the stage. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘See now he is laughing and inventing his own steps.’&nbsp; Reba pointed out and giggled. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘But it seems as if he even practiced these steps a lot.’ Sam said wisely. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">All enjoyed the dance, because, unlike other acts it was laced with humour. Everybody was really satisfied with the results when it was announced as the last group won the first place. Their performance was really different from others with mesmerizing dance steps and sequence.</span> </p>

   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">At the table, Helley was sitting in a very serious mood surrounded by the nervous pixies and courtiers. The look on Helley’s face suggested Reba, Emma, Sam and Rema might have transgressed the limits on their movement. They guessed Helley might have been displeased as might be they were not supposed to move around in the Faixieland without any fairy accompanying them. The words of Emily, at the restaurant, expressing surprise on seeing them roaming alone immediately resounded haunting them. They feared that they may be punished for the same. Emma however, pulled up her courage to ask, ‘Is something wrong Helley? You look disturbed.’ </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Sit you must be hungry, I’ll talk to you once you have had your dinner.’ Helley replied in her typical very polite and humble tone.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Once everyone had finished their dinner, Helley broke the silence sounding serious, ‘It is high time I tell you about something which you must know. I know about all your anxiousness to know more about the chosen ones, even about you Rema.’ To ease them up a little, she looked at Rema with a gentle smile and declared, ‘Today I will reveal all the mysteries.’ She took a long pause, waiting for others to say something. As nobody spoke she continued, ‘It started years ago when the Faixieland was ruled by beautiful Madam Robert Roberta. There is another place, Merryland, which was formed after a tragic incident. It was a part of the Faixieland earlier. There was a king from the mirror world who suggested partition of the Faixieland into two halves to make it easy to rule. After the partition he was made king of the other part by, the Faixieland queen, Madam Robert Roberta. Even though he was the king, his authority was limited and subject to periodical interventions by the queen. He started liking her and wished she could agree to marry him. However Madam Roberta was later married Sir Nicholas as she never came to know of the King’s liking for her. King Numpone was deeply saddened, and, wanted to completely break free from the queen’s influence. He raised his own army without letting Madam Roberta to have any inkling of it, and later  declared himself and his administered part independent of Faixieland naming it Merryland. He gradually developed deep dislike for Madam Roberta and her subjects in Faixieland, and, periodically attacked Faixieland so as to get control over Madam Roberta. Many pixies and fairies lost their lives during these attacks and the ensuing wars. As time progressed the King and Madam Roberta died but the hostility between Faixieland and Merryland fairies never ceased. As the situation worsened, leading to more loss of lives on both sides, the fairies went to an astrologer to find some solution. Even before anybody could tell anything, the astrologer asked for some pixies to be deputed with him to enable him find the solution for which they had come. The pixies were brought before him and he cast a spell on them, and said, “These are guarpies they will guard the Faixieland. The positioning of stars and my ancient studies reveal that, three foreigners will come to save the fairies. Each will have different skills. I will inform you when they come. But if unfortunately not me, then these guarpies will smile, signalling the foreigners’ arrival.” Now you know everything, what are chosen ones and why were we so happy. Will you help us?’</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘We will indeed help you all.’ Reba said.</span> </p>

   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘How are we going to carry our stuff there?’ Reba questioned.</span> </p>

   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Are there any kind of books on Merryland?’ Sam asked.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Well we have a library you could go and see if any books are there. Or else if anyone wants to come with me to the museum they can. You could learn many things even in the museum. The pixies will show you the library.’</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Okay thanks.’ Sam said.</span> </p>

   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">The pixies accompanied them to the library. It was between the ground floor and the basement. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">They passed Emma’s room, took a left then a right, and reached a deserted corridor. There they heard a feeble voice asking, ‘When it all started’. Reba and Sam looked around but could not spot anybody. One of the pixies immediately answered ‘</span><span style=" font-size:1.0rem; font-style:italic">first of November</span><span style=" font-size:1.0rem">’. This was birthday of Helley’s relative, and coincidentally, Reba’s birthday too. Immediately with the answer the wall in front cracked, revealing a steep spiral staircase.&nbsp; The pixies satisfied Raba and Sam’s curiosity by informing them that this system of password entry was developed only after a witch known as Camorte stole flaxiweeler, a very important and rare ingredient for potions.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">They climbed down the staircase and reached the huge library. It had many shelves, as high as twelve feet, loaded with books. The theme and the type of books in each shelf were displayed in bold gold emblazoned letters on a wooden plank attached to the shelf.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">The books in the ‘Magic for Beginners’ section had magical powers in them. Whenever anybody touched them they started telling about the chapters and how to perform the magic described in them. At the far end of the library there were two long tables, for people to study on, whilst for the librarian there was a small table in the corner of the library. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Mr Bookinu the librarian was a short old bald man. He was mostly snoring during his duty time.  He had a wide smile with a button nose and large cold eyeballs. As was his usual practice, he welcomed Reba and Sam to the library. As a librarian he only had to usher in visitors inside and guide them on how to use the library. He showed Reba and Sam their way in and soon started sawing logs on his table.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Both Reba and Sam started looking for books on Merryland and Faixieland history.</span> </p>

   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">After sometime Reba exclaimed, ‘Sam here’s the shelf for books on Merryland.’</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">There were many books on that shelf. They took a few titled, ‘How to Get into Merryland’, ‘THE FAIRIES WHICH WILL LIVE FOREVER IN MERRYLAND’, ‘Behaviour of MERRIES towards the FAIXIELAND FAIRIES’, and ‘Servants Of King Numpone’.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <img src="57beaa33-96c1-4eca-a89b-ce4bf60c471e20037458619508905.020.jpeg" alt="C:\Users\MY HUSSAIN\Desktop\New folder\scan0023.jpg" style="-aw-left-pos:0pt; -aw-rel-hpos:column; -aw-rel-vpos:paragraph; -aw-top-pos:0pt; -aw-wrap-type:inline; width:96.78%; " /> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Reba, see in this book the fairy has written there are some riddles we have to solve to get into Merryland. It says that the fairies who returned from Merryland have stated that there are nearly ten riddles to get into the Merryland.’ As soon as Sam finished, Reba called, ‘Sam come here.’</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">He went towards Reba as she pointed towards the three books she was having and&nbsp; she said, ‘See Sam, in these books, “the servants of king Numpone”, “fairies living forever” and “the behaviour of Merries”, I see one name that is common, Camorte.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">This one tells that she is alive now. She was the king's most respected courtier, and this one tells that she murdered seven Faixieland fairies, all in just one spell. She is believed to be the most powerful witch. She is hiding somewhere in the Merryland. I don’t know why, but I suspect her. Maybe she gave him a kind of elixir of love, and that is why she stole the flaxiweeler as it is a very important ingredient for the potion, see it is written in this book,’ She said pointing towards another book titled “Extreme Elixirs and their uses by K M Paulus”, ‘also it’s written that extra dose of it can cause disorders, and, increases stress and anger. Maybe she gave extra dose to the King Numpone with a strand of Madam Roberta’s hair because she was to be the target of his hate. The dose made him hate Madam Roberta, thereby leading to the destruction of their kingdoms. Camorte must have thought to rule the Merryland after King Numpone’s death.’</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Brilliant! In the book which I was reading, it is mentioned that Camorte killed many Faixieland fairies while they tried to kill her to get inside the Merryland, she used to first guard the entrance. It says she is hiding somewhere far away from the entrance.’</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘I think you all should hurry up.’ Rema had just woken up from her short nap she took on the librarian’s table.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Yeah, we are trying.’ Reba replied.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">They didn’t realise how fast time passed in the library, as it was almost time for Emma to return.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">As soon as Emma joined them in library Sam inquired if she saw anything interesting in the museum.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘A big thing. I saw a witch’s statue who was the king’s servant; she was really brutal towards the Faixieland fairies. I suspect her because of her acts. I don’t remember her name very nicely but it started with a ‘C’. Something like Canotem.’</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘We too suspect her. Her name is Camorte not Canotem, by the way.’ Sam said. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Immediately Emma exclaimed, ‘Oh yeah! Camorte.”</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘We should think of a plan to get into the Merryland, as soon as we can, as she is hiding there for ages. And for that we need time to work ourselves up, as there are up to ten riddles to solve to get entry into Merryland. Rest of the things we can plan in Merryland itself.’ Reba suggested. The rest agreed and set off to learn more about Merryland through books.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">When Reba and Rema were in their room she immediately started reading the books Reba borrowed from Mr Bookinu. On the other hand Emma and Sam too in their rooms started exploring about Merryland through a few books they got from the library. They also had one book that Rema specifically suggested for them in the library.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">After a while Sam and Emma went to meet Reba and Rema in their room. They asked whether it would be wise to do a combined practice of all they have learnt to make light of their tedious task, and also, to get the real feel of entering the Merryland. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Reba supported them as it seemed a very practical approach. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Instantly Rema flicked her wand and a big black smoky hole with a little glitter appeared in the air. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Reba, Sam and Emma stepped inside it and found themselves in a big room, with no walls visible because of haze and smoke. Rema didn’t enter the room. Suddenly one grey deer, from amongst a herd of seven to eight others, appeared in the room out of nowhere. Emma unexpectedly found a hoop appearing in her hand. Sam asked her to recognise the deer that looked different from the others and hoop it. Emma went forward and voila! She hooped the correct deer. All the deer started to disappear and it got pitch dark. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">After a while, as the haze and smoke cleared, two doors appeared on two opposite sides of the room. Reba peeked in both of them. In one room she could sense some food and medicines kept there, before a long flash dazzled her eyes. She quickly closed the door and opened the next one. Here, she could see nothing, as it was dark, but smelled some food and medicines here too. As she closed the door she saw Emma had fainted. She quickly dragged her inside the second door with dark room. When they were inside Sam asked how they will see what is happening.  Reba smiled, and a few moments later, her wings started glowing as they were glow-in-the-dark. Soon they could bring Emma back to senses using the medicines, and also gave her some food.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Slowly and steadily they progressed further and at last the phantasmagorical walls started to disappear and they came back to Reba’s room. Rema congratulated all for solving all the riddles. She reminded them that they shall encounter and solve up to ten different riddles to enter the Merryland. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Tired but content on having been successful in solving their practice riddle, all of them immediately fell into deep slumber on Reba’s bed. </span> </p>

   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Reba Emma, I am going downstairs.’ Sam said as he left the room. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">After a while he returned and said, ‘Helley and the courtiers are asking all of us to go down to meet them.’</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">They all went downstairs where all the courtiers including Helley and the pixies were waiting. The pixies, courtiers and Helley, all seemed to be very pleased to see the chosen ones headed for their mission in the Merryland.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Happy journey!’ they all shouted together in unison with happiness and joy.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘These pixies will drop you near the entrance of Merryland.

   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">&nbsp;‘Four? So it means that we can take Rema along with us.’ Sam asked excitedly.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Yeah of course.’</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">After that there were no more conversations. It was not a very serious silence. It was like everyone could still talk to each other through their eyes. As one person looked towards the other they exchanged meaningful smiles and gestures.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Sam, Emma, Rema and Reba came back to their rooms and to while away their time waiting for their departure, they sat on a divan playing fairy chess. Rowena was with them helping, as they were not familiar with the rules for fairy chess.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">The rules were simple; they could play with as many players as they want. There were five wooden guarpies, two magical creatures and one queen. The players had to say whatever they wanted in mind, and the wooden pieces move on their own. The pieces were never out of the game. Rather the players took control over the opponent’s pieces, instead of moving them out of play by considering them dead. The winner had to take over the whole board and the opponent’s pieces to mark his victory and if they had to call off the game midway at a particular time the player with maximum pieces was declared winner.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Reba, Emma and Sam played for a long time as they wanted to tide over their anxiety waiting for their departure to be announced by Helley. After an hour or two maybe, Helley spoke, ‘It’s time to leave, now.’</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">As Sam, Reba, Emma and Rema proceeded towards the Merryland entrance, the pixies followed them. After sometime Sam asked the pixies, ‘Why can’t you come with us?’ </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">The eldest and the oldest one replied, ‘Wee ain’ allowe’ there.

   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">After sometime the pixie spoke again, ‘Thees eez the Merryland entrans, go forwaard eet eez eenvisible.’</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Rema sat on Reba’s shoulder as they went forward. Everything started blurring and it became absolutely dark. All of a sudden they saw five sheep and three lambs. In the beginning they could not understand what they had to do, until Reba asked Emma to touch the odd looking sheep or lamb. Emma thought for a while and touched a white lamb. But oh! It was not the correct answer. Everything started to rotate in a whirl and it seemed as if before even their journey had started they will have to quit, not only journey to Merryland, but also, the journey of their life! Their worst nightmares appeared coming true. They thought they might lose their lives today.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Boom! All of a sudden they found themselves floating in the air, drawn by strong air currents as if in tornados and cyclones. Once again the sheep and lambs appeared but this time giving the foursome, more anxiety and stress. This time Emma had to be right else she would risk everyone’s life. No one could see anything clearly as it was such a powerful hypnotizing effect that blinded everyone, including Rema. They were not in control of themselves, but somehow Sam and Reba managed to keep themselves as well as Rema and Emma conscious. </span> </p>

As they touched a lamb, with white fur and a scratch on its hoof, the hypnotizing effect stopped, and they landed on the floor of a smoky room.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Yay! Sam see they are conscious again! Reba exclaimed pointing towards Rema and Emma.</span> </p>

All but Reba tightly clasped each other’s hand and coalesced to form a single lady. Reba couldn’t believe her eyes at this transformation.

   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">The ones transformed had lost their spiritual existence and, their physical body existed merged with each other. Some invisible force was guiding their action and movements.</span> </p>

   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">After sometime Maple said, ‘Reba, as you are new here, I, will be your guide. Emma you stick on with Luna and Sam,’ she said turning towards Sam, ‘You will be with Simon.’</span> </p>

   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">The room was beautiful, with a big bed for Reba and a small one for Rema. In the corner there was a big wardrobe in which Reba and Rema's dresses were already arranged. It had a large window with beautiful white curtains, and, a lantern placed beside the big bed.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">They shut their eyes and were deep asleep as soon as they fell on the beds. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">The next day the foursome woke up early and met in Emma’s room. They discussed and correlated their experiences at Merryland, and also, about their guides here. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">They were all enjoying their time when Reba noticed that Rema was hiding something from her, as she didn’t seem to enjoy their company.</span> </p>

   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘What?’ Reba almost screamed.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘All the pixies know everything but they aren’t allowed to help their masters and mistresses.’ Rema whimpered.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Oh! Don’t be guilty.’ Emma said, frowning at Sam and Reba, and caressing Rema to give her comfort and consolation and help her overcome her guilt. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Sorry.’ Sam apologised.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Forget about everything Rema; let’s go to the entertainment room.’ Though Reba solaced Rema but actually she kept wondering how the pixies know everything. However, she didn’t bother to ask Rema as she thought that right now Rema was not in the right frame of mind to answer it.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">They went to the entertainment room, and saw Maple and a pixie talking to each other. When they saw them Maple said, ‘Hi, Moony wanted to meet you, she thought you all must be twenty or twenty two years old.’ Maple said as everyone smiled.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">The entertainment room could display all types of feelings; it depended on the person, what he or she wanted to be. As the invisible walls could change colours depending on feelings of those present, in the room everyone saw a different coloured walls at the same time.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">As right now Reba was really tense, she saw dark purple walls. But after a few moments it changed into sky blue and then again into dark purple. She asked Maple why the colour of the walls was changing. In reply maple said, ‘The colour that you saw at the first represents your feeling right now, as bright it will be, as happy you are , as pale it will be, as nervous you are, as dark it will get as tense you are. The second colour is what you have to be. Gradually the walls will become lighter along with changes in your mood.’</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Oh, I see.’</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">After sometime Reba saw a bright orange colour. There was a mystical power, no doubt, that made them feel better every second. They forgot all their conflicts and stress and everyone felt really nice after being in the entertainment room just for fifteen minutes. They didn’t want to leave but Maple insisted them to have their breakfast first. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">They went to the dining hall and waited till everyone else was seated. A tall male fairy, who looked about twenty-two years old sung,&nbsp;‘Cook Peter, cooks things you see in books, just think what Peter has to cook.’&nbsp;</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Reba thought of a boiled egg, toast and some orange juice. Suddenly everyone noticed a male&nbsp;xhino who looked just like his master, the Cook Peter, on whose shoulder he was sitting. The xhino was waving his wand in the air and some ingredients such as bread, egg and juice appeared on a table. The table was created by the xhino just a moment ago. The xhino flicked his wand again and magical power entered the Cook Peter. His hands now worked faster than a fly. In a few seconds Peter flew up to Reba and gave her, her breakfast.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">It took some time for all of them to finish their breakfast as Lavender spoke, ‘Did you all sleep nicely? Were the beds soft and warm enough for you all?’&nbsp;</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Reba answered, ‘Oh, yeah they were.’</span> </p>

   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">They went to Maple’s room accompanied by her and saw her xhino Moony. </span> </p>

   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Lavender ordered to take them for tour.’ Maple said</span> </p>

   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">They flew with all their strength. There were many shops, with small and large chocolates, some as big as the size of a grown-up male fairy. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Let’s go to that shop.’ Maple said pointing towards a large shop named ‘THE LAMICHOCONGLATE’. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Do you know that this is the only sweet shop where mirror world dishes are made.

The rush of merries to purchase their chocolates was an enjoyable sight. They bought two lamingtons for Emma and Sam, one small and one big chocolate model that looked exactly like Reba and Rema, and one Tomosmilla, a large chocolate cake with beautiful chocolate wings, rainbow sprinkles, and many other tiny chocolate models of different flavours  available in the lamichoconglate. They took the model with them as they couldn’t finish eating it; they kept it in the bag Helley gave them back in the Faixieland.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">After the sweet shop they went to the great common museum for Merryland and Faixieland. It was at the far end of Merryland. It wasn’t actually a part of either Merryland or Faixieland but was visited by fairies of both places. Its ceiling was dome shaped and was painted in white and brown.</span> </p>

   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Its inside was even bigger with models of kings and their belongings.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Camorte!’&nbsp; Emma had sighted Camorte in a few places and at the moment was pointing at a statue right in the middle of the museum. Camorte was standing with all the other courtiers who were not alive but dead!</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Emma, Reba, Rema, Sam, Maple and Moony went towards the statue, and tried to read an encryption written at the bottom of the statue carved on a piece of wood. That made it tougher to read. </span> </p>

   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Camorte was such a cruel woman.’ Emma remarked.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Indeed she was.’ Moony agreed.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">After silently observing things Maple spoke, ‘It’s too late let’s go back to the palace.’</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">It was evening, and, they had been out since the morning. They rushed back to the castle; it took them one and a half hour to reach back. As they entered inside the palace, Maple spoke, ‘I’ll give you a tour of the Merryland palace, come with me.’&nbsp; They changed their direction and flew towards the back portion of the palace.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">There they saw a big clock, as big as three baby elephants. It was round in shape and had only one hand. ‘It is the Mapier’s clock. It shows you whether enemies are nearby or not. It also has a secret function which no one knows, not even the pixies or xhinos.’ Moony said.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">After that they went inside the palace. Maple showed them the royal photo frames. The first one was that of King Numpone, beside it was a queen named ‘Becky’ and another king named ‘Ben’ on the other side. The last one was ‘Lavender’.</span> </p>

Though there was something lurking in Reba’s mind. She was pondering, if they continue to enjoy Merryland when will they finish off Camorte? How much damage would she have done till that time to other people. Now they definitely can’t sit idle. She immediately woke up Rema, and told her, about her thoughts. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘You are right. Let’s not waste time.’ Rema supported Reba’s thoughts and feelings. ‘Let’s ask Sam and Emma, if they have got any idea, of how to proceed further.’</span> </p>

   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘We could kill her when she is asleep.’ Sam suggested in a really casual manner, when they explained their purpose of coming to his room so early in the morning.</span> </p>

   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘I might know where we can find her.’ Sam said.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Where?’ Reba exclaimed excitedly, as everyone fixed their gaze on Sam unbelievingly.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘I don’t know exactly, but we could just guess it a bit. Maybe we can find some evidence in the library or maybe we have to ask people, what she had been what she used to do, and things like that.’ Sam said a little embarrassed by the stares and expressions suggesting belief in forced expectation.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Okay, so Emma and I are going to ask people about that.

   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Reba and Emma went outside to inquire about Camorte by talking to merries. Sam and Rema on the other hand remained inside searching for literature and artefacts which could help them get leads and information about Camorte.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Reba I think we should go to the oldest fairy living here.’</span> </p>

   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘It’s too rude, but people here will love to tell the chosen ones their age, won’t they?’ Emma sighed.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">They reached a park and waited for some time, looking in all directions to sight an old fairy. Suddenly they saw a fairy about ninety years old or maybe older. They went near him and sat beside him on the bench he was sitting and tried striking a conversation. As expected talking to the fairy became easier after Reba and Emma told him that they were the chosen ones. After some general discussion about Merryland, Reba came to the point, ‘Excuse me sir, would you mind telling us who is the um… oldest, sorry I mean the eldest merry in Merryland?’</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘You have come to the right person. Follow me.’ The fairy whispered. He had long silver beard and a hoarse trembling voice.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">He led Reba and Emma inside a huge old house and brought two small couches, asking them to sit on them. As they sat the fairy went to the kitchen and brought with him some water and apples. There was a long silence as nobody knew what to expect. The old man too was calm and still as if he had been waiting for his prey. As he finished his apple, he stood up and went upstairs. He came back with a small pot about the size of a bangle in diameter emitting purple-orange smoke. He cast some spell on it. Reba and Emma stood blank and heard him take names of ‘Sam’ and ‘Rema’, how could he know Sam’s name although they never told him. Besides Rema was a name given by Reba, how could he know it? Within five seconds or so, Sam and Rema popped out of the pot the old fairy had brought. The fairy still didn’t say anything to them. Sam and Rema were as confused as Emma and Reba were. The old fairy again went upstairs to keep back the pot.</span> </p>

   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">After a few minutes he returned.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘I am Pullery. Don’t judge me by my name; I am not as funny as it sounds. I have spent almost all my entire life, searching for you all. There are a few things that I will not tell you. Once you finish your task you will know what they are. No one knows the things which I know. However, I am going to reveal to you a really important prediction. One of you will leave us forever and ever. But you still have time to return or, stay to finish off your task. I know why you all have come here. I can tell you where Camorte lives.’</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Why were you waiting for us? You could have fought Camorte alone if you knew her whereabouts, and had all the powers.’ Sam retorted.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘You don’t understand what I say! God pity children like you!’ He seemed irritated. ‘I am growing senile and weak. People think I am out of my senses and no one pays attention to what I say. I can’t defeat Camorte all by myself, but I can help you; I can tell you where you can find her.’ As he spoke further he seemed to be more mystical and calm.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Having regained his composure, he started once again in his usual voice, ‘Camorte has a black cat, which she uses to disguise herself. Whenever she thinks anyone can see her, her soul enters the cat, and her body becomes invisible hanging up in the sky. She has a weakness, if you hit something on her nose, she becomes stiff. This was all that I think I should tell you. Rest you will know later.’ Saying this Pullery laughed in a mysterious manner and left. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">A hush descended over the foursome. They all stood up and came out of the house and flew back to the palace. They returned back to their rooms and started thinking about what Pullery had said.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Simon came to their room and asked them to come downstairs for the lunch.</span> </p>

   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Emma and Reba understood that he must have got some idea.

At last they gave up and decided to take rest for some time. They didn’t leave the library; instead they rested their heads on the tables. Suddenly Reba saw some kind of pot on the window.

   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘What is this Reba?’ Sam asked.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Wait and watch.’ Reba said as went inside the dusty room. The moment she entered she lost her independent will. She was not her usual self as somebody else’s soul had replaced her own and was probably guiding her actions and thoughts too. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Reba went towards a table with a folded paper kept on it. She opened it and started reading from it.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘What’s happened to her? Is she in her right mind?’ Sam asked after looking at the dusty paper Reba was holding a few moments ago .You would barely like to touch or hold it. They were surprised to see the paper blank which Reba was just pretending to read. Though they were perplexed and couldn’t understand anything, they decided to follow her directions.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">After sometime Reba opened a drawer and took out a photo frame. Suddenly her eyes welled with tears. No one could realise what was happening, but kept quiet. Reba then walked towards a wardrobe and took out a dress. She hung it back and went towards a frame with the royal family photo. She then asked, ‘Where is Camorte?’</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Go east or the west, you will not find her.’ Spontaneously came the reply from behind the still frame.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Where will I find her?’ Reba asked more confidently.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Come to me I’ll tell you.’ </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Reba went close to the photo frame, followed by Rema, Emma and Sam. They found themselves drawn inside the frame by some invisible force. They twirled in complete darkness until they could once again set their foot on ground. They found themselves taken back in time to the actual evening when the picture might have been completed by the painter. Reba went close to Rema Roberta, and asked, ‘Where is Camorte?’</span> </p>

   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">They were once again plunged in complete darkness and, with the same twirling, were brought forward in time to their present existence in front of the photo frame. Once they returned they forgot everything that transpired inside frame, except, where they needed to look for Camorte. Maybe they didn’t forget where she was because it was the reason why they were taken inside the photo frame.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Let’s go to the basement.’ Sam said.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Why?’ Emma asked.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘You don’t know?’ Reba questioned.</span> </p>

   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Surely they were not aware of each other’s presence inside the frame. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">After a long conversation they could understand that they all went inside frame wherein they were revealed about Camorte’s hideout. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">They went outside, and unfortunately met Luna. She, unlike her sister Maple or her friend Simon, always questioned them sceptically, whenever she saw them away from their rooms. Initially they suspected her to be on Camorte’s side. But could Luna be on Camorte’s side? They could overcome their doubts and abandoned the idea of Luna betraying them, as they came to know that her family had been serving the royal palace since the time of Helley’s ancestors.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Somehow they managed to distract Luna, and sped past the corridor. They flew towards the exit where mapier’s clock displayed no signs of danger.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">They then flew towards the museum immersed in complete silence. As they entered it they started searching for the staircase. After a long stressful quarter of an hour wandering and running around here and there, they found the stairs. They went down the stairs and reached its end leading to corridors in all the directions. At last they found another staircase at the end of one of the corridors leading finally to the basement, which resembled more like a covered field.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">There they saw a cat, a dog and a mouse chasing and running after each other. The cat was white with green spots; it looked weird as in Faixieland many cats had green fur.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">They were disappointed not getting any clue that could lead them to Camorte, they flew back to the palace. They were feeling embarrassed as they had been sighted and observed by merries several times, excitedly flying towards their destination and later returning back with gloomy faces. They were worried of losing trust and confidence of the merries, and they losing hope of their fairy world coming out of the evil influence of Camorte. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">All of them went to Emma’s room and sat silently thinking about their next step. Reba took a small chair kept beside a big wardrobe. Sam turned a chair kept beside a table, and as the back of it was not providing good support, sat with his legs on both sides of the chair, allowing him to stretch his legs. Emma was sitting on her bed with her legs crossed and face resting on her palm. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘This might be our last chance. We need to be right, or else be ready to face a whole lot of doubts on our ability to help these pixies, fairies and merries. I feel uncomfortable with so many suspicious doubting expressions of merries, now questioning our presence here.’</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Why not combine your ideas?’ Emma suggested. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘But how do we combine our ideas?’ Reba asked.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Let’s talk to Rema Roberta; she can help us teleport ourselves there with or without the pot.’</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Okay let’s try it, hope it works.’</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">They went to the same room, with a lot more confidence than before. Perhaps their earlier forays were coming in handy this time with more familiar passages, more familiar walls and most importantly more familiar rooms. They went to the room that belonged to Rema Roberta. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Excuse me Queen, How can we reach Camorte?’</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Wait, she’ll come to you.’</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">They waited in anticipation to get further clues but there was no reply even after waiting for a few minutes. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Queen?’ Reba broke the silence.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">No replies.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">They did all sorts of things to attract Queen Rema’s attention, but failed in all their attempts. They couldn’t understand what she meant by “Wait”. Was she being too reticent or was she selfish in not extending help or was she not happy with their presence in fairy world trying to resolve its problem. Did she ever care for her people of the kingdom? Well no one knew what was going on queen’s mind.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Seeing the confusion prevail Reba suggested, ‘Let’s do whatever she tells. Wait for the right moment. Till that time we need to think about how we are going to kill Camorte. We can’t possibly challenge her into a physical fight.’</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Should we make weapons?’ Sam suggested.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Of course not, she will snatch them and not allow us to use the weapons.’ Emma rebuffed his suggestion.</span> </p>

Moments later Reba returned back to her room with mixed feelings for Rema. Emma and Sam were left alone, both just glancing at each other and giving bewildered and befuddled looks to each other.</span> </p>

   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Again silence engulfed them, as they were totally clueless, till Emma spoke, ‘Have you ever thought of the point Reba was arguing on? Why didn’t Rema help us?’ </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘It’s not a big point, besides it’ll make Rema more stressed and lonely.’</span> </p>

   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">They both proceeded for their respective inquisitions.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Emma could hear sobs coming out of Reba's room once she reached there. Usually Emma entered the room without warning, but today, she knocked and waited for the reply. Reba took a while to open the door. She smiled, and let Emma in. Emma didn’t expect this behaviour from her. She thought that Reba would still be mad at her for coming to her room. Instead Reba was too polite and courteous, completely in command over her emotions. However, her room setting betrayed her composed self she presented in front of Emma suggesting her how crazy she could probably go. The pillows were lying on the ground, the bed sheets had tear stains on them, and it looked as if she had been sobbing for quite some time. Well whatever we think is not always right, no one would have ever thought that Reba and Rema’s friendship wouldn’t last long. Emma sat on the edge of the bed while Reba took a place close to her on a carpet, with her hands tied around her legs and face resting on her knees. Emma started talking about general issues trying to make her get into a conversation to raise the topic of Rema and her fight. Reba however, mostly kept quiet, lost in her own thoughts, just nodding from time to time. Exasperated, at last Emma mumbled loud enough so that Reba could hear all her words clearly, ‘When will you talk to Rema?’</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Why did you come to my room?’ Reba asked ‘I don’t want to talk about her, if you don’t have anything else to talk about you may just leave me alone. You all keep your sympathies for her, but I am not going to be duped by her anymore. I just asked her a question and she could simply have clarified, but she didn’t.’ Reba seemed to say it all in one breath almost screaming at Emma. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Emma left her room and returned back to hers. On her way she saw Sam opening his room door. They just looked at each other blankly not bothering to narrate their experience. She understood that he too didn’t succeed in making Rema to break her silence with Reba.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Reba in her room was still feeling left out alone in her thoughts. She felt miserable, she thought of running away but then thinking of her friends gave up the idea. After sometime she found herself immersed in long silence, feeling like crying. Thoughtless, sad and desperate, she knew nothing but to talk to Rema to. She no longer could withstand this aloneness. After all how long can she allow this animosity last?</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">She stood up and immediately proceeded towards Rema. She felt being supported by some unknown power, guiding her towards the basement where Rema was to be found. Though everyone had last seen Rema in the entertainment room, Reba had no doubt she would find Rema in the basement.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">As soon as she saw Rema, she started feeling guilty and apologetic. Her thoughts and feelings so gripped and paralysed her, that she stopped flying almost thirty feet above the ground and started falling towards some icicles growing on the basement floor, losing half her consciousness. Rema tried to save her with spells. She took out her wand and shouted, ‘Paso-Peebos’ which was meant to make objects fly. But pixie spells did not work in the basement, and being an immature pixie she was not aware of it. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Reba was now just five feet above the ground. Rema took out a sharp hair-clip she was having and threw it with all her might towards the central icicle, which was the tallest. The clip disappeared as it touched the icicle and instantaneously the icicles disintegrated into a pile of white confetti, on which Reba gently landed without getting injured. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Reba got up straight and said, ‘I don’t know what happened right now, but I am really sorry for what happened in Emma’s room.’</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘I am sorry too.’ Rema said.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘I know that something tragic happened. There is pain in my body, and I have lost my memory. I don’t remember what happened. Oh! Your hand is bleeding.’ Reba informed concernedly immediately on spotting her bleeding hand.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Let’s first go to Sam and Emma and ask for their forgiveness for giving them trouble due to our behaviour. Let’s invite them to entertainment room where I will narrate everything.’ Rema said.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Reba entered Emma’s room, apologized for her behaviour, and told her to come to the entertainment room. While Reba was with Emma, Rema was leading Sam to the entertainment room.</span> </p>

There are immortality suuds, happiness suuds, magical suuds which give you magical powers and the last one that I know is friendship suuds, it never lets you be alone. Your friends will get their own suuds if they are honest and faithful in their friendship. Eventually all these get converted into immortality suuds while doing their own duty too. There are many other suuds that I don’t know, and probably no single pixie is aware of all the suuds. These are really complicated stuffs. If they aren’t used for right purpose, the owner will be punished. It can even freeze your brain if you are wearing a hair-clip as suud, or, it can freeze your heart if you are wearing it as a locket.’ Rema explained.</span> </p>

No pixie was ever allowed to interfere in the Mexie-war, which divided not only the boundaries but also the hearts of fairies. And we don’t know what Camorte is up to, she doesn’t even let her servants know about it. Of course, if there are any left now.

   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">There were many rides similar to the ones in the mirror world fairs. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">The foursome enjoyed their roller coaster ride, which was not on its track, but was flying in the air, held by some mysterious force to its definite path. It reached highest possible and then all of a sudden it made a sharp steep fall near a shop. The riders would have definitely been thrown out, had it not been the wings of the roller coaster which tightly leashed them to their seats.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem"> The next one was known as “The Twitch” which started with a jerk even before everyone could board and take their seats. The riders were pulled by the wings. The wings were shaped like a bowl which could accommodate four merries. It was a slow and steady ride until it fell down with a lot of force and started its journey up back again with sharp twirl and small twitches. As the movements of the ride straightened, the wings were turned upside down with a few merries falling from it. The merries started flying at the right time and took their seats safely back again. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">As they alighted after the ride had ended they felt exhausted and decided to take a brunch before moving on to the ride. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">The foursome’s next ride was a thrilling experience. It looked like a flying boat getting right under each other and sometimes even crashing into the other boats.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">They then saw some flying horses in a nearby space. They decided to have a closer look and saw a ride in which the riders had to win a hurdle race mounted on the flying horses. They didn’t participate but just stood behind the barricades and watched the competing riders. It was the only place except the palace and LAMICHOCONGLATE where they could rest their feet.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">After sometime they were dead tired. They were also hungry as their earlier brunching was hurried in excitement to get to the next ride. They went to a shop, and had a Merryland delicacy comprising tasty custard pudding served with chocolate wings. After a while they returned to the palace. It took them half an hour to get back, because they were staring at all the shops and merries and everything on the way, and, they were also too tired to fly at full speed.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">They met in Emma’s room after freshening themselves up with scented water and aromatic face wash.</span> </p>

She quickly dressed up and pottered outside her room. It was a day before her birthday and she was as happy as she could ever be. She didn’t talk to anyone about her birthday, because usually no one ever wished her except Emma, Sam and Moola. Besides she thought that it didn’t matter to anyone except her. If her parents had been alive they might have been very happy and probably would have showered her with gifts.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">After sometime she thought for how long she hadn’t talked to Rowena, Emily and Christophe. She went to her room to write a letter to them. She took out a huge and beautiful white quill from the cupboard, but she couldn’t find any parchment in there. She went near the window to distract herself and stood there watching some unicorns flying nearby. Suddenly she saw a parchment stuck on the horn of one of the unicorns. As she wanted it, she murmured wishing the unicorn to give it to her. In a swift glide the unicorn reached her and she plucked the parchment off its horn.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘You can understand what I said?’</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Yes I can.’ The unicorn replied in a majestic and polite voice. Reba was surprised. She was just asking it in a very casual and obviously-of-no-use kind of voice. She didn’t expect it to actually fly towards her.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">She took the parchment and started writing her letter. Soon she finished putting down her thoughts in the letter and began to wonder how is she going to post it. Just then a unicorn came and said that it will take the letter wherever Reba wants it to reach, but only if she is sure to make it, her own unicorn.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Of course you are.’ Reba replied.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">The unicorn took the letter in its mouth and disappeared in a swift movement. Reba looked at the clock. It was quarter past seven in the morning. She decided that after a short walk she shall wake up Rema.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">As she wombled in the hallway outside her room, she suddenly heard something strange, ‘Mo’e outta the way’.’ A fairy was mopping the corridor, in whose way Reba was coming.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Sorry.’ Reba moved, and asked the fairy’s name.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Iglestra, i’ my nam’, people call me the mopping-fai’e’</span> </p>

After being for such a long time amongst the fairies, today she concluded that the fairies did all the cleaning works. Musing about all these she met Moony on the way.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘You’e awake so mornin’’ Moony exclaimed as she saw her.</span> </p>

   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Reba went to her room, and woke Rema up as it was quarter to eight. Rema went to the washroom for freshening her up and. After sometime they together proceeded towards the dining hall and ate their breakfast with Emma and Sam, who were already waiting for them. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">After breakfast Reba looked at the clock and when she turned back everyone was gone. She searched for them everywhere but they were nowhere in sight. She once even lost her way back room trying to find the others. She figured it out after sometime though. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Where have they gone?’ Reba mumbled. She went searching for them in the washrooms, alleys entertainment room, their rooms, but they were nowhere to be found. She went back to her room and slept.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem"> She woke up at two in the afternoon and rushed to the dining hall where she found everyone else. She started eating her lunch, but her fork fell down. As she bent down to pick it up and saw all the legs moving away from her. In panic she lifted her head and banged it on the downside of the table. Till the time she managed to lift her head everyone was gone. </span> </p>

She dozed off again. But this time didn’t wake up till the morning of the next day. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">She dressed herself in beautiful clothes, as she remembered it was her birthday and wished somebody could make out that it’s her special day. , and went out. She didn’t find Rema in room so she just thought of going for the breakfast. But as she stepped out of her room, she heard a voice in unison, ‘Happy birthday!’ All the courtiers, Helley, Sam, Emma and Rema shouted. Reba was overjoyed to see them and excitedly started opening the presents they had brought with them. The first one was from Emma; it was a beautiful maroon jumper with white flowers only around the neck, and a small ‘R’ for Reba between the flowers.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">The next gift she unwrapped was from Sam. It was a quill and parchment which could write whatever they said, and a beautiful fairy perfume bottle.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Christophe, Emily and Rowena gave her a unicorn- saddle, which looked more like a crown with two weird dangling ropes for the rider to hold. Once worn it could understand where ever Reba wanted to go for a ride. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Do you even have a unicorn?’ Sam asked pointing towards the saddle.</span> </p>

She flew on to the top of the palace and perched herself there on the edge. She was thinking about Moony and her rude behaviour. She was also reflecting on what kept waking her sleep. She sat there for a long time, but all of a sudden she lost her balance and fell off. She could just flap her wings at the right time to prevent her from having a nasty fall. Wait, there was no ground here so if she would even have fallen what would have happened? She stopped flying, and started falling intentionally. </span> </p>

   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem"> They decided to have a quick game of chess before breakfast was served. It seemed as if they were probably getting addicted to fairy chess. </span> </p>

   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">As they finished their breakfast they discussed about what their next step to get to Camorte and finish her off should be. All of them had different ideas, and could not narrow down to the best option for mission. At last they concluded not to worry about anything as they had learned quite a bit about Camorte, and the kind of tactics she has. They decided that if they face Camorte anywhere suddenly, they should immediately stiffen her by throwing something at her nose. After that they could quickly think of a plan to defeat her.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Sam informed that he was finalising details and characteristics of the cat Camorte had.

   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">After sometime they went back to their rooms. Reba was reading a book, while Rema was trying to establish telepathy with Moony to ask her whether her spells work in the dungeon. Soon after clarifying all her doubts Rema returned to her bed and took a short nap waking up around seven in the evening. She had to remind Reba that they needed to get ready for the ceremony. As usual Reba was so engrossed in the book she was reading that she had forgotten about the ceremony and had lost the track of time. They quickly dressed up and reached the vow ceremony.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Reba had a turquoise evening gown with matching shoes. She had difficulty in making a bow in her hair, however with Rema’s help she could complete it beautifully.</span> </p>

As per the fairy tradition and regulations all the vow ceremonies started with a dance. Reba, Emma and Sam didn’t dance as they didn’t want to. Suddenly Reba saw a cat trying to enter into the ceremony hall sneakily with very strange actions. Reba noticed a small child watching it, being amused at its movement. As soon as his mother called him and he turned the other direction, Reba saw sparks coming out of the cat’s paw. It was definitely something very abnormal, the cat had mystical powers it was doing magic! Reba had a hunch that the cat was Camorte.</span> </p>

   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Wait let me see.’ He quickly took out his notebook. ‘All the features are same.’ He said awestruck. ‘Let’s catch her without any delay.’ </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘No! See you two be ready to defend, I will do something, okay?’ Reba whispered as she moved away from them. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Ya, but…’ Emma could hardly utter her doubt before Reba was already gone. She hurried with quick short steps towards the exit door and immediately rushed to Madam Roberta’s room. King Numpone had made the room her memorial after she died. Reba for the first time entered this room helped by some spiritual and mystical power which always guided her in unknown places and circumstances.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">The large room had gathered thick dust and looked as if it had not been in use for years. It had portraits of Madam Roberta everywhere.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Reba opened a drawer and took out a green potion and kept it on a table before moving on to open an almirah. She moved in a weird way, suggesting an invisible force guiding her. She took out another bottle from the almirah, which looked empty but had some invisible potion inside it. Reba seemed nicely aware and knowledgeable of its contents. Probably her spiritual guidance seemed to be in total control of her senses. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">She held the green potion in her right hand and mumbled ‘Elixir of love,’ and then picked the second bottle chanted ‘and Elixir of death,’ She mixed them together and murmured ‘when mixed, form the elixir of victory, defeating the enemy, burning it up with jealousy, into ashes.’ The potions in the bottles turned purple-greenish which she proclaimed to be “the elixir of victory”.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Reba took this potion along with herself to the ceremony hall where everyone was enjoying themselves, totally unaware of what the foursome. She joined Sam and Emma and announced to them, ‘See I’m going to undertake something very risky. Please pay attention to whatever I say or do. Be ready and stand in defence, as I already said, right? I am going.’ Seeing the worried face of her friends she added, ‘I don’t have the time to explain things, but please trust me. Do not spend useless thoughts on about what I am going to do, just focus on your roles.’</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘But Reba you need to…’ Emma tried to pull her in a discussion. Avoiding her Reba slowly went closer towards the cat.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Camorte could sense danger, as Reba came closer. She shunned her cat avatar to her normal appearance. Surely she understood she stood little chance of a fight with all her feet one the ground. The pomp and gaiety in the hall all of a sudden was replaced by cries and shrieks. The merries huddled themselves into corners leaving more space for the cat, and now Camorte. Everyone’s attention was now glued to moves of Reba and Camorte.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Camorte was now ready to fight. She looked fierce, with tight curls in her open hairs, and, black outfit with black and green dragonfly wings. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Rema threw a bowl towards Camorte's nose, and as told by Pullery it didn’t do much good except that it startled Camorte and left her incredibly stiff. It was enough for Reba to lurch towards taking care not to spill ‘the elixir of victory’. Suddenly Reba felt long cold fingers grip her wrist.</span> </p>

   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">It was Peter, the Cook Peter! He pulled her back and sang, ‘What did you think? Cook Peter cannot cook something as evil as this? Ahaan?’ </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Reba pushed him with her elbow, as Sam caught him from behind, Rema dazed him with her spells.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Reba dashed towards the now conscious Camorte as Emma threw a bowl from behind hitting Camorte’s nose. As she once again became stiff Reba poured the entire potion in her mouth.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Another of Pullery’s prediction was coming true. As Camorte cast the killing curse on Reba. In just a fraction of a second Reba was on the floor as Camorte’s body became ashes that lay around Reba's feet and clenched fists.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">There was complete silence in the hall. Tears were profusely falling off the eyes of Emma who was sitting beside Reba’s still corpse, so did Rema, Sam, Rowena, and even Helley. But then something which took them aback.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">The tears of the pixies were drawn to each other in the air and formed a beautiful golden bird with a blue pearl on its forehead. As it was brought to life by some unknown powers, it flew towards Reba and subsumed into her body. </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <img src="57beaa33-96c1-4eca-a89b-ce4bf60c471e20037458619508905.040.jpeg" alt="C:\Users\MY HUSSAIN\Desktop\New folder\scan0038.jpg" style="-aw-left-pos:0.4pt; -aw-rel-hpos:column; -aw-rel-vpos:paragraph; -aw-top-pos:-9.15pt; -aw-wrap-type:inline; width:100.00%; " /> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Slowly Reba opened her eyes and found herself amidst claps and cheers all around her. All the pixies and xhinos got a new suud, including Rema. Reba asked, ‘Is Camorte dead?’</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">The whole hall shouted, ‘Yessss!’</span><span style="width:14.82pt; text-indent:0.0em; display:none;"></span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Helley approached Reba and took off her crown.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">She said, ‘I am so sorry Reba, let me tell you a long kept secret. You are the daughter of Queen Rema Roberta.’ There were lot of sighs and loud awes from all corners and sides of hall at this sentence.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Just then a soft sweet voice was heard proclaiming, ‘Queen, was true.’ Everyone looked towards the direction the voice came from and found the fairy Olivia. Everyone gave way to her to move to the centre of the hall near Helley and Reba. Helley encouraged her to continue, ‘Come on Olivia say all you have to say.’</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">Seeing everybody fixing gaze on her, Olivia continued, ‘Queen Rema Roberta once came to talk to me in private. She told that her daughter will take her wings. It meant that before dying. She gave me her wings, and stayed in the palace for a long time as she could fly no longer. Queen Rema Roberta wished that if not her daughter another girl resembling her might certainly deserve to take her wings. I always had trust in and a blind believer in all that her majesty said or wished, as such was confused whether to give you your wings.’ No one could help but appreciate Olivia for her faithfulness. They together appealed to Helley to reveal more.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘This locket which you are wearing is a suud your mother gave us. You now know why, I was not replying to your letters. I wanted to avoid revealing that you are my aunt’s daughter. This suud is a royalty suud, meaning, it is friendship suud, immortality suud, and all others you could probably imagine. Now, all the pixies have one suud as they were loyal to you, and, Emma and Sam have one because their friendship to you was true. These however are invisible suuds.’ Helley quickly added, seeing the confused faces of Emma and Sam. She went on to elaborate, ‘Reba, because you are of royal family you could talk to unicorns. When you were small my mother, your mother’s sister, sent you to the mirror world after killing your mother. She wanted to be the queen. However, ever since taking over the reign after her, I waited for this moment to hand you over this crown which always belonged to you. I am so sorry, Reba, it’s your Faixieland.’ Helley said, bowing a little and offering the crown to Reba.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘That’s why you knew Rema Roberta and her spirit and soul always seemed to guide you to the right path.’ Sam guessed once Helley stood erect.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Yeah you’re right, hope you all forgive me for not revealing all this to you earlier.’ Helley pleaded once again.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘I don’t blame you, ‘kay? But I don’t know how could I could be reborn.’</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘The pixies and xhinos cried, that’s why.’ Helley replied.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘I don’t understand,’</span><span style="width:14.24pt; text-indent:0.0em; display:none; -aw-tabstop-align:center; -aw-tabstop-pos:138.85pt"></span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Whenever pixies and xhinos cry this happens, and the invisible force and power in your locket, and, the pixie tears made you take a rebirth, but it was this time that all the pixies cried together and golden swan formed out of their tears for the first time in front of our lives. We had only heard about in tales passed down the generations. We mostly see white swans that mean that only one pixie has the grieve, but for the first time we all have seen a golden one. If it was a white one you might not have been revived after experiencing such a powerful killing curse, that too performed by Camorte. Apart from these factors you also had the enemies ashes on your foot which means that you finished her, and lastly you had true friends’ hope which makes the effect even stronger.’ Helley explained.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Well I have a question; I didn’t ask it before ’cause I knew that you all may lie. I saw a dream in which I had unbearable pain in my body and as I saw two shiny things the pain disappeared. Can you relate it to whatever is happening right now?’ </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘It is about the same thing Reba, one of the shining things was pixie tears, and, the other was your locket. The dream abruptly stopped because in reality you were to die.’ </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Oh.’</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Excuse me,’ Emma jumped in between their conversation, ‘Did anyone check the Mapier’s clock, for the danger?’</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Yeah, we always check it before functions, right, but what happened now?’ Lavender asked her courtiers.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘No the courtiers didn’t neglect their task. Perhaps they did check the clock, however Peter might have done something to that clock. You know maybe because he was on Camorte’s side.’ Sam wisely interpreted, assuaging her bad mood</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘And why was Moony acting so differently on thirty first of October when I met her outside my room? She nearly broke my head. Maybe she too was controlled by Peter. I could never have imagined that she would try to harm me or even have ill feelings towards me.’ Reba revealed her doubts. Waiting for some time she offered. ‘Lavender can we have an agreement?’</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Yeah sure.’ Lavender replied.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Can the Merryland and Faixieland be one again,&nbsp; though you could rule it?’</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Sure, and now that, there won’t ever be the Merryland, merries or xhinos. It will be once again be only the Faixieland with its fairies and pixies.’ She said smiling, ‘And this crown I would like to give to Sam and Emma.’ </span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Helley, you are the true owner of this crown.’ Reba said handing back the crown to Helley.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘Thank you, princess, you still are one. Ain’t you?’ Helley said hugging Reba.</span> </p> 
   <p style="margin:0.00% 0.00% 2.66%; line-height:130%; font-size:1.0rem"> <span style=" font-size:1.0rem">‘And we can’t keep this either.’ Sam and Emma handed over the crown back to Lavender.</span> </p>
