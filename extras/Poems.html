<div class="maintext">
<span class="poem" id="P3">
	<p>The Sun still rises and sets, <br>
	The stars still twinkle,<br>
	giving me the hope to be that shining guide,<br>
	for every lost traveller in the deep black void.<br></p>

	<p>Everything is the same,<br>
	Yet my obliviousness creates a hollow in me,<br>
	Turning soon into a dark void,<br>
	that engulfs all those around me.<br></p>

	<p>The lost traveller,<br>
	still walks under the never-ending dark sky,<br>
	hoping to make his way through,<br>
	fighting all the way with his own dark self.<br></p>

	<p>The pressure of this walk suffocates me,<br>
	The void has taken over,<br>
	my baggage is getting heavier,<br>
	I am losing myself in this nothingness.<br></p>

	<p>The traveller has in himself a void of nothingness,<br>
	His burden is eating him away,<br>
	suffocating him in foreign lands;<br>
	The stars still twinkle above him, unnoticed.<br></p>

	<p>Wrong was not my path nor destiny,<br>
	I and I myself was killing me.<br>
	My burden is too hard to carry,<br>
	It drowns me constantly in oblivion and helplessness.<br></p>

	<p>Thus the wise, valiant traveller,<br>
	abandoned his baggage,<br>
	collapsing the void,<br>
	and filling the hollow in his new self.<br></p>

	<p>I am free again, <br>
	from the struggles of carrying my burden,<br>
	Guided now by the twinkling stars above me,<br>
	Those stars who never left me.<br></p>

	<h2>The Traveller's burden</h2>
		<h3>Another poem written on the spot. I wrote this because probably it described what I felt at that time. <br><sub>-June, 2021</sub></h3>

<div class="maintext">
		<span class="poem" id="P2">
		<p>Sorry, <br>
		But, yes I do want glory,<br class="parachange">
		You can’t understand me,<br>
		Reflect at thee,<br>
		Before hurting me.<br></p>

		<p>I am obnoxious, yes I know!<br>
		Don’t interrupt me and break the flow<br>
		I speak big words,<br>
		Yes, I live my worlds!<br></p>

		<p>Trifling with my feelings,<br>
		Without knowing their meanings,<br>
		Either understand and play,<br>
		Or, away you stay!<br></p>

		<p>Know,<br>
		The difference between lonely and ‘lone,<br>
		Because lying ain’t same as bamboozling,<br>
		You ought to respect your offspring,<br>
		‘Cause to you they cling.<br></p>

		<p>I poured my heart out in this poem,<br>
		And now I have no more complaints from thee,<br>
		With a lightened heart now I flee!<br></p>

	<h2></h2>
		<h3>An impromptu poem wrote when I was angry with my family. (I was so obsessed with archaic words, its funny) <br><sub>-October, 2020</sub></h3>
</span>
	</div>




<div class="maintext" id="P1">
	<span class="poem">There I was,<br>
		On railway station at five in the morning,<br>
		So early it was,<br>
		I lost my sleep and was in mourning.<br>
		And Oh! What a disgusting surprise,<br>
		The boggy we were in,<br>
		Got in the train somehow,<br>
		And lost all my exhaustion,<br>
		I don't know how.<br>
		Streams, and farms and rivers I saw,<br>
		Also a cat,<br>
		Scratching something with its paw,<br>
		Oh! It was an old bat.<br>
		Mountains, forests I saw,<br>
		On my journey by train,<br>
		Tall trees, big bushes I saw,<br>
		While following the crow's trail.<br>
		And what a fun it was,<br>
		Sitting and writing all I saw,<br>
		The boggy was the main cause,<br>
		To make me remember the day I was scratched by a cat's paw.<br>
		Stations came and passed,<br>
		Crows and birds flew,<br>
		But not even halfway was passed,<br>
		As the cold wind blew.<br>
		The chaos of people,<br>
		The horns of trains,<br>
		Filled my ears,<br>
		Do they not have brains?<br>
		I saw white dandelion,<br>
		First time in my life,<br>
		I saw a person in train carrying a chandelier,<br>
		Jumping out of the moving train with his wife.<br>
		After trees, bushes, hills and struggle reached my destination for a good cause,<br>
		What an unusual trip it was!<br>

	<h2>The Train Journey</h2>
		<h3>I wrote this poem on a train to my grandmother's place. It was a cold morning, and we had to depart without any prior preparation because of an emergency. <br><sub>- October, 2019</sub></h3>
