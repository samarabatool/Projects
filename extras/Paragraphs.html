		<h2>Embarassment from a child's perspective</h2>
		I hate it when adults try to make younger ones feel comfortable and not embarrassed. You know why? Puppets cannot move their limbs comfortably, it’s upon the puppeteer to decide that. Children can’t either, it’s upon their guardian to decide that. Children act upon the wish of their parents. They wear what their parents give (it could even be a lime-green jumper with bubble-pink corduroy pants). Their emotions rely on the expression of their parents, even if they want to laugh they cry, and vice versa. People think wearing traditionals affect the alpha-gen. But, not all children are the same, not everyone is ashamed of their traditions. It’s just the kind, and color, and materials that matter. It’s a common misconception that they feel embarrassed between their own families. But, it’s not that everyone avoids their family. It’s just when you try to force them into your ideas, and assumptions of how one should act towards their family, when they get all jumbled up and confused and not embarrassed. 
		<br>Now, here I am not exactly saying that the children never get embarrassed, but it’s just that these confusions, nay hesitations, that extended for a long period start making the child feel awkward. To understand this in a better way, we shall refer to the embarrassment typology,  Sharkey and Stafford’s (1990).
		<br>Sharkey and Stafford based their typology on Sattler’s (1965) collapsing the 38 categories into 6 main ones, consisting of :
	<ul class="intextul"> <li>Privacy violations: Small children are not usually affected by this reason, except for maybe when parents or guardians display their baby-photos to their friends, or other such circumstances.</li>
		<li>Lack of Knowledge and skills: Children are not affected by this (in relation to their elders) either, because it is an accepted fact that elders are elders and no one can do anything in that.</li>
		<li>Criticism or Rejection: Most children with siblings face this, after being tagged as uncool or incapable of amusing them.</li>
		<li>Awkward acts: Many children often feel this nowadays. Like after committing a mistake and looking at their parents’ face, and blushing crimson.</li>
		<li>Appropriate image: Children usually experience this when they think they are oddly dressed in a public gathering, or that their parents don’t dress them nicely or give them fancy lunch-boxes.</li>
		<li>Environment: This, too, is not as common in children either.</li>
	</ul>

		<h2>The Bigger Picture</h2>
		I hate those people who notice just the details of everything. They, who just refuse to see the ‘bigger picture’. They, who would see rocks, and trees, and pebbles, and water; but the luxurious view of rocky-shores, they just won’t see. <br>

		Such kind of people tend to be materialistic too. It’s so easy for them to sort out their own problems, the most specific ones, but to view it as a common big image, they would just lose  their minds. <br>

		Such people tend to hurt others. They would see a kid is fatter than normal kids; they would see a kid being taller than normal kids. But to put it all together in a larger frame, to see the kid having perfect body-proportions, they are not capable of that. <br>

		Such people also tend to expose their raw observations in public. The raw observations which hurt the one about whom they are. They make the person lose confidence in themselves, ruining their mental health completely. <br>

		<h2>Expressing Emotions</h2>
		You don’t understand me, neither can you ever understand me. It is because you take me as any other creature on this planet. Ignoring all the complexities of humans in me. You take my expressions as my final emotions, and then claim to know me. <br>
People with unbearable amount of emotions, tend to express them unnaturally; in places they are expected to feel guilty, they might unusually smile (or in worst cases even laugh). It’s not their problem. It’s just that they haven’t got enough time or space to express their emotions. Sometimes, such people tend to pour their hearts out into blank pages; either with a pen, or paint-brush, or their words on the blank pages of other people’s minds. <br>
Humans are extremely complex creatures, with emotions more than any other animal. Although not all of them would express such emotions; they keep it to themselves. Away from others who might take them unimportantly. Everyone thinks their emotions are valuable enough to not be trifled with by others. All the emotions of stress, anger, tiredness, and uncountable others, are held by people in themselves. Unable to express them, these suffocate them, resulting in sudden outbreaks of these emotions as tears, or smiles, or other expressions.
