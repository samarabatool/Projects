<h3>I designed this page for keeping a record of my writings. Many of the drafts that I had created couldn't be saved due to them being manuscripts of when I wasn't in the habit of keeping each of my draft safe. The ones that I have curated here are all from after 2019. <br>
There are also some of my other works here...</h3>
